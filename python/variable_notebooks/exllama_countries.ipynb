    "The Cuban Missile Crisis, also known as the October Crisis (of 1962) (Spanish: Crisis de Octubre) in Cuba, the Caribbean Crisis (Russian: Карибский кризис, tr. Karibsky krizis, IPA: [kɐˈrʲipskʲɪj ˈkrʲizʲɪs]) in Russia, or the Missile Scare, was a 13-day (October 16 – October 29, 1962) confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, which escalated into an international crisis when American deployments of missiles in Italy and Turkey were matched by Soviet deployments of similar ballistic missiles in Cuba. Despite the short time frame, the Cuban Missile Crisis remains a defining moment in American national security and nuclear war preparation. The confrontation is often considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale conflict, nuclear war.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1961, the US government put Jupiter nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. It had also trained a paramilitary force of Cuban exiles, which the CIA led in an attempt to invade Cuba and overthrow the Cuban government. Starting in November of that year, the US government engaged in a campaign of terrorism and sabotage in Cuba, referred to as the Cuban Project, which continued throughout the first half of the 1960s. The Soviet administration was concerned about a Cuban drift towards China, with which the Soviets had an increasingly fractious relationship. In response to these factors, Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, agreed with the Cuban Prime Minister, Fidel Castro, to place nuclear missiles on the island of Cuba to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Castro in July 1962, and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the campaigning for the 1962 United States elections, the White House denied the charges for months and ignored the presence of Soviet missiles positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from Florida. Later, the missile preparations were confirmed when a US Air Force U-2 spy plane produced clear photographic evidence of medium-range R-12 (NATO code name SS-4) and intermediate-range R-14 (NATO code name SS-5) ballistic missile facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this was reported to President John F. Kennedy, he then convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisers, in a group that became known as the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM). During this meeting, President Kennedy was originally advised to carry out an air strike on Cuban soil in order to compromise Soviet missile supplies, followed by an invasion of the Cuban mainland. After careful consideration, President Kennedy chose a less aggressive course of action, in order to avoid a declaration of war. After consultation with EXCOMM, Kennedy ordered a naval \"quarantine\" on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba.[5] By using the term \"quarantine\", rather than \"blockade\" (an act of war by legal definition), the United States was able to avoid the implications of a state of war.[6] The US announced it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union.\n",
    "\n",
    "After several days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kennedy and Khrushchev: publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to not invade Cuba again. Secretly, the United States agreed with the Soviets that it would dismantle all of the Jupiter MRBMs which had been deployed to Turkey against the Soviet Union. There has been debate on whether or not Italy was included in the agreement as well. While the Soviets dismantled their missiles, some Soviet bombers remained in Cuba, and the United States kept the naval quarantine in place until November 20, 1962.[6]\n",
    "\n",
    "When all offensive missiles and the Ilyushin Il-28 light bombers had been withdrawn from Cuba, the blockade was formally ended on November 20. The negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union pointed out the necessity of a quick, clear, and direct communication line between the two superpowers. As a result, the Moscow–Washington hotline was established. A series of agreements later reduced US–Soviet tensions for several years, until both parties eventually resumed expanding their nuclear arsenals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev, and the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started. Khrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and his ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place. According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation\".[7][8]\n",

    "Crisis Summary: CUBAN MISSILES — 1962\n",
    "A crisis in the East/West protracted conflict\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "There were three crisis actors in the most ominous of all East/West crises, the United States, Cuba, and the Soviet Union. The crisis lasted from 16 October to 20 November 1962. Pre-crisis After the 1961 Bay of Pigs abortive invasion (see Case #181), Cuba became one of the central issues of U.S. foreign policy: the U.S. viewed Cuba as a potential source of communist-oriented subversive activities in Latin America. When the U.S. discovered the presence of Soviet military personnel in Cuba on 7 September 1962 it called up 150,000 reservists. The Soviets mobilized on the 11th. Although persistent rumors circulated concerning the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba, Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin denied the charges, and Premier Khrushchev gave his personal assurances that ground-to-ground missiles would never be shipped to Cuba. On the eve of the Missile crisis Washington did not openly challenge the Soviet statements concerning the defensive character of the weapons being sent to Cuba.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "The U.S. crisis was triggered on 16 October when the CIA presented to President Kennedy photographic evidence of the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba. The U.S. responded with a decision on the 20th to blockade all offensive military equipment en route to Cuba. When this was announced on 22 October, a crisis was triggered for Cuba and the USSR. An urgent meeting of the UN Security Council was requested by both the U.S. and Cuba on the 22nd, and by the USSR the next day. On the 23rd as well, the Soviets accused the United States of violating the UN Charter and announced an alert of its armed forces and those of the Warsaw Pact members. That day Cuba responded by condemning the U.S. blockade and declaring its willingness to fight.\n",
    "\n",
    "A resolution was adopted on the 23rd by the OAS calling for the withdrawal of the missiles from Cuba and recommending that member-states take all measures, including the use of force, to ensure that the government of Cuba would not continue to receive military material. On 24 October the Security Council adopted a resolution requesting the Secretary-General to confer with the parties. On that same day, U Thant began mediation by sending identical letters to Khrushchev and Kennedy which proposed that the Soviet Union and the United States enter into negotiations, during which period both the shipment of arms and the quarantine would be suspended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moscow's major response to the crisis was a letter from Khrushchev to Kennedy on 26 October offering the removal of Soviet offensive weapons from Cuba and the cessation of further shipments in exchange for an end to the U.S. quarantine and a U.S. assurance that it would not invade Cuba. The situation was exacerbated on the 27th when a U.S. U-2 surveillance plane was shot down. That day another Khrushchev letter was received in Washington offering the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba in exchange for the removal of U.S. missiles from Turkey. U.S. mobilization and aerial reconnaissance flights were stepped up. And on the 27th President Kennedy sent the Soviet premier an acceptance of the proposals contained in the letter of 26 October while making no reference to Khrushchev's second letter of the 27th. The following day Khrushchev notified the U.S. government that he had ordered work on the missile sites in Cuba stopped. He agreed to ship the missiles back to the USSR and promised that UN observers would be allowed to verify the dismantling of the sites. At the same time he warned Washington that U-2 reconnaissance flights over Cuba must be stopped as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crisis continued at a lower level of intensity for several more weeks due to Cuban President Castro's demands concerning a U.S. pledge not to invade his country. On 30 October U Thant began talks in Havana, and Kennedy agreed to lift the quarantine for the duration of the talks. When Cuba rejected UN inspection, the U.S. resumed the quarantine and air surveillance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kremlin sent Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan to Cuba on 2 November to try to persuade Castro to allow UN inspection. When this proved unsuccessful, a U.S.-USSR agreement was reached on 7 November allowing U.S. inspection and interception of Soviet ships leaving Cuba and the photographing of the missiles. The following day the superpowers negotiated the removal of the IL-28 bombers which Castro had claimed were Cuban property. Castro's agreement was conveyed to the U.S. on 20 November 1962, which terminated the Missile crisis for all three actors. The U.S. naval quarantine was lifted immediately, but aerial surveillance continued until the agreement was completely carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "U Thant's mediation efforts had an important impact on crisis resolution. The acting Secretary-General managed to act as a facilitator and kept lines of communication open by contacting both parties. He also used formulative mediation by highlighting common interests and making substantive suggestions to both sides for diffusing the crisis. Overall, U Thant's mediation effort was a significant factor in easing tensions between crisis actors which contributed to a more rapid termination of the crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three regional/security organizations were involved in this crisis--the OAS, NATO, and the WTO. Kennedy sent Dean Acheson to Paris on 23 October to brief NATO's Permanent Council on U.S. measures against Cuba. Involved were members of the Warsaw Pact, whose forces were put on alert, and Latin American states which offered military assistance to the U.S.\n",

The U.S. responded with a decision on the 20th to blockade all offensive military equipment en route to Cuba. When this was announced on 22 October, a crisis was triggered for Cuba and the USSR. An urgent meeting of the UN Security Council was requested by both the U.S. and Cuba on the 22nd, and by the USSR the next day. On the 23rd as well, the Soviets accused the United States of violating the UN Charter and announced an alert of its armed forces and those of the Warsaw Pact members. That day Cuba responded by condemning the U.S. blockade and declaring its willingness to fight.\n",
    "\n",
    "A resolution was adopted on the 23rd by the OAS calling for the withdrawal of the missiles from Cuba and recommending that member-states take all measures, including the use of force, to ensure that the government of Cuba would not continue to receive military material. On 24 October the Security Council adopted a resolution requesting the Secretary-General to confer with the parties. On that same day, U Thant began mediation by sending identical letters to Khrushchev and Kennedy which proposed that the Soviet Union and the United States enter into negotiations, during which period both the shipment of arms and the quarantine would be suspended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moscow's major response to the crisis was a letter from Khrushchev to Kennedy on 26 October offering the removal of Soviet offensive weapons from Cuba and the cessation of further shipments in exchange for an end to the U.S. quarantine and a U.S. assurance that it would not invade Cuba. The situation was exacerbated on the 27th when a U.S. U-2 surveillance plane was shot down. That day another Khrushchev letter was received in Washington offering the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba in exchange for the removal of U.S. missiles from Turkey. U.S. mobilization and aerial reconnaissance flights were stepped up. And on the 27th President Kennedy sent the Soviet premier an acceptance of the proposals contained in the letter of 26 October while making no reference to Khrushchev's second letter of the 27th. The following day Khrushchev notified the U.S. government that he had ordered work on the missile sites in Cuba stopped. He agreed to ship the missiles back to the USSR and promised that UN observers would be allowed to verify the dismantling of the sites. At the same time he warned Washington that U-2 reconnaissance flights over Cuba must be stopped as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crisis continued at a lower level of intensity for several more weeks due to Cuban President Castro's demands concerning a U.S. pledge not to invade his country. On 30 October U Thant began talks in Havana, and Kennedy agreed to lift the quarantine for the duration of the talks. When Cuba rejected UN inspection, the U.S. resumed the quarantine and air surveillance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kremlin sent Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan to Cuba on 2 November to try to persuade Castro to allow UN inspection. When this proved unsuccessful, a U.S.-USSR agreement was reached on 7 November allowing U.S. inspection and interception of Soviet ships leaving Cuba and the photographing of the missiles. The following day the superpowers negotiated the removal of the IL-28 bombers which Castro had claimed were Cuban property. Castro's agreement was conveyed to the U.S. on 20 November 1962, which terminated the Missile crisis for all three actors. The U.S. naval quarantine was lifted immediately, but aerial surveillance continued until the agreement was completely carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "U Thant's mediation efforts had an important impact on crisis resolution. The acting Secretary-General managed to act as a facilitator and kept lines of communication open by contacting both parties. He also used formulative mediation by highlighting common interests and making substantive suggestions to both sides for diffusing the crisis. Overall, U Thant's mediation effort was a significant factor in easing tensions between crisis actors which contributed to a more rapid termination of the crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three regional/security organizations were involved in this crisis--the OAS, NATO, and the WTO. Kennedy sent Dean Acheson to Paris on 23 October to brief NATO's Permanent Council on U.S. measures against Cuba. Involved were members of the Warsaw Pact, whose forces were put on alert, and Latin American states which offered military assistance to the U.S.\n",

    "Crisis Summary: CUBAN MISSILES — 1962\n",
    "A crisis in the East/West protracted conflict\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "There were three crisis actors in the most ominous of all East/West crises, the United States, Cuba, and the Soviet Union. The crisis lasted from 16 October to 20 November 1962. Pre-crisis After the 1961 Bay of Pigs abortive invasion (see Case #181), Cuba became one of the central issues of U.S. foreign policy: the U.S. viewed Cuba as a potential source of communist-oriented subversive activities in Latin America. When the U.S. discovered the presence of Soviet military personnel in Cuba on 7 September 1962 it called up 150,000 reservists. The Soviets mobilized on the 11th. Although persistent rumors circulated concerning the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba, Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin denied the charges, and Premier Khrushchev gave his personal assurances that ground-to-ground missiles would never be shipped to Cuba. On the eve of the Missile crisis Washington did not openly challenge the Soviet statements concerning the defensive character of the weapons being sent to Cuba.\n",
