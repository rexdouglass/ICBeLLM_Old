Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
Nigeria experienced a minor border crisis with Cameroon from 2 May to 26 September 1987.
Summary:
The border between Cameroon and Nigeria is porous and imprecise at several points. On 2 May 1987 a small number of Cameroonian troops intruded into Nigeria's Borno Province, triggering a crisis for Nigeria. (However, on 1 July Nigeria's President Babangida described it as a minor incident.) Nigeria's major response was to increase border security.
On 24 September Nigeria's Chief of Army Staff, Major-General Abacha, visited Cameroon--to affirm the ""commitment of Nigeria toward peace and progress and toward the stability and peaceful coexistence between Cameroon and Nigeria."" Abacha said that his visit had given the two countries an opportunity to correct some wrong impressions. Two days later, on 26 September, a joint military border patrol was formed to monitor the border. That act terminated a low-intensity crisis in West Africa.
The UN, the U.S., the USSR, and the OAU were not involved in this crisis.
(On 29 September, Cameroon's Army Chief of Staff arrived in Nigeria: Brigadier-General James held talks at the airport with General Abacha on the incursions into Nigeria by Cameroonian soldiers. Relations between Nigeria and Cameroon entered a new positive phase following the visit of Babangida to Cameroon on 8-11 December. This did not, however, prevent other border incidents, including one full-scale crisis [see Case #410--Cameroon/Nigeria III, in 1993-94].)...

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
Prolonged ethnic strife in Sri Lanka generated a crisis with India from 3 June to 30 July 1987.
Background
 The roots of this South Asian crisis lay in the one-way migration of Indian Tamils to Ceylon (later, Sri Lanka) during the extended period of British rule: from 1757 to 1947 in the Indo/Pakistani subcontinent, from 1796 to 1948 in Ceylon. During the nineteenth century Indian Tamils, pushed by the endemic poverty of their homeland, the South Indian province of Madras (later, Tamilnadu), and pulled by the opportunities for employment in the labor-intensive rubber plantations of Ceylon, migrated in large numbers. By the time of independence, the Hindu Tamils comprised approximately 20 percent of Ceylon's population, with a vast majority of Buddhist Sinhalese.
From the outset the Tamils, concentrated in the northern Jaffna Peninsula, perceived acute discrimination in all aspects of Sri Lanka's society, economy, and polity. Ethnic resentment erupted into open rebellion in 1983 under the leadership of the most militant and disciplined Tamil group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the LTTE, best known as ""the Tamil Tigers"" or ""the Tigers."" Their goal for more than a decade has been an independent state for the Tamils of Sri Lanka, the vast majority of whom reside in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
Pre-crisis
 There have been several escalation points in an increasingly bitter ethnic conflict. One was a large-scale offensive launched by Sri Lanka's armed forces against the Tamil Tigers on 26 May 1987, ""Operation Liberation."" Not for the first time, the plight of their ethnic and religious kin generated a massive pressure group in Tamilnadu, a state in south India, which urged the government of India to intervene on behalf of Sri Lanka's Tamils. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi...

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
Sa'udi Arabia and Iran were embroiled in a crisis over Iranian pilgrims from 31 July to October 1987.
Background and Pre-crisis
 No pilgrimage by Iranians to Islam's Holy Places since 1981 had passed without incident. Their annual demonstrations in the streets of Mecca and Medina challenged the Sa'udi concept of pilgrimage, the Sa'udi interpretation of Islam, Sa'udi control of the Holy Places, and the legitimacy of Sa'udi rule.
The first catalyst to tension between Iran and Sa'udi Arabia in 1987 was a statement by Iran's former pilgrimage representative, Musavi Khoiniha, a powerful hard-line figure in Iran. In a speech early in July Khoiniha reportedly said that a mere march or demonstration by Iranians would not suffice. He demanded that the Sa'udi regime allow Iranian pilgrims to enter the Great Mosque in Mecca at the end of their demonstration, where their representative would explain Iran's case regarding the Iran/Iraq War. That demand put the Sa'udi security forces on a high state of alert.
After difficult negotiations Iranian and Sa'udi officials reached an agreement that the demonstration would end half a kilometer before the Great Mosque. But tension remained high, so Sa'udi Arabia tried to persuade the Iranian pilgrimage representative, Hojjatolislam Mehdi Karrubi, to cancel the demonstration lest violence break out. Karrubi refused and declared that the Sa'udi government would be responsible for any disorder.
On 28 July Ayatullah Khomeini called on all Iranian pilgrims to take part in a ""disavowal march"" to ""echo the crushing slogan of the disavowal of pagans and apostates of world arrogance, headed by the criminal USA,"" adding that ""it is most disgraceful for Islamic countries and for heads of states that foreigners should penetrate the secret military centers of the Moslems."" At the same time Iran's ruler called on the pilgrims ""to avoid clashes, insults and disputes"" and...

A crisis in the Angola protracted conflict
Background:
Angola and South Africa were embroiled in another of their many cross-border crises from 3 October 1987 to 22 August 1988.
Summary:
A crisis for Angola was triggered by a South Africa Defence Forces attack on SWAPO bases in Angolan territory on 3 October 1987. This was one of a number of such intrusions by the SADF since 1978, noted above, part of Pretoria's continuing struggle to thwart SWAPO's attempt to create an independent state of Namibia in South African-controlled South-West Africa. For Angola the incursion posed a threat of grave damage. For South Africa, Angola's provision of sanctuary to SWAPO forces threatened its control over South-West Africa and, generally, its primacy in the southern African region.
Angola's initial response followed its behavior in earlier intrusions of this kind: it appealed to the UN Security Council. As in the past, the Council unanimously passed a resolution condemning South Africa's ""continued and intensified acts of aggression"" against Angola and called for the immediate, unconditional withdrawal of its forces from Angola's territory. However, it did not impose economic sanctions on Pretoria.
This routinized Security Council behavior did not, per se, catalyze a crisis for South Africa. The trigger occurred on 10 December, when Angola launched a counterattack against SADF units.
Serious clashes between the SADF and Angolan forces continued intermittently for months, intertwined with the ongoing civil war in Angola between the MPLA-led government and UNITA. The latter's leader, Jonas Savimbi, claimed on 12 November that his forces had repulsed a three-month offensive by government forces. In mid-December, the Head of the SADF, General Johan Geldenhuys, admitted for the first time that his troops were fighting alongside UNITA inside Angola. Government forces had the active backing of 2,000 Soviet military advisors and of a large Cuban contingent...

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
Kenya and Uganda experienced a brief border crisis from 14 to 28 December 1987.
Background
 Tension between these East African neighbors increased as a result of Uganda's decision in May 1987 to transport its coffee crop and fuel by its own national railroad, which was less expensive than the Kenyan road system. Kenya retaliated by imposing strict border controls on traffic from Uganda, which caused heavy delays. Uganda blamed Kenya for closing the border unilaterally.
Summary:
Both states perceived a crisis the same day, 14 December 1987. Ugandan troops reportedly crossed the border first, near the town of Busia, triggering a crisis for Kenya. In the clashes that ensued, which triggered a crisis for Uganda, 15 Ugandans were reportedly killed. On the 18th Kenya ordered Uganda's high commissioner to leave the country.
President Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya and President Museveni of Uganda met at the border town of Malaba on the 28th and agreed on a series of steps to ease the tension. Security forces were to be pulled back from the frontier by both sides and replaced by regular police. Moreover, the border was to be reopened to regular traffic. These conciliatory acts terminated the crisis.
There was no involvement by the UN, the OAU, the U.S., or the USSR in this crisis....

A crisis in the China/Vietnam protracted conflict
Background:
Vietnam and China were embroiled in a crisis over the Spratly Islands from 14 March until late April 1988.
Background
 The Spratlys and the South China Sea generally had long been part of the territorial domain of imperial China. Control by the ""Middle Kingdom,"" however, eroded along with its decline as the regional hegemon during the penetration of European powers into Southeast Asia in the sixteenth century. But the issue of sovereignty over the Spratlys remained dormant until the late nineteenth century.
France emerged as the dominant power in Indochina and the islands of the South China Sea, a status formalized in the France/Annam treaty of 1874. China was compelled to accept France's primacy following the defeat of its navy in the Sino/French war of 1884-85. Extending its influence southward from its Indochina colony, France sent a survey mission to the Spratlys in 1927 and formally annexed the islands in April 1930.
Japan emerged as the next claimant: with most of coastal China under Japan's control early in the Sino/Japanese war (see Case #56--Marco Polo Bridge, in 1937-38, in China/Japan PC), the Japanese navy occupied the Spratlys in March 1939. The Itu Aba Island within the Spratly archipelago became a submarine base for Japan's invasion of the Philippines in December 1941. And the Spratlys assisted the Japanese conquest of Southeast Asia.
At the end of World War II, (Republican) China reasserted its claim to the Spratlys. So too did France, now restored to control over Indochina. China established a military post on Itu Aba. In October 1950 the newly (formally) independent Vietnam proclaimed possession of France's maritime boundaries in the South China Sea, including the Spratlys. And with the end of French rule in 1956...

Begin Crisis Narrative
A crisis in the Honduras/Nicaragua protracted conflict
Background:
The decade-old conflict between Nicaragua and the anti-Sandinista contras generated another crisis for Honduras from 9 September to 7 November 1989.
Pre-crisis
 Nicaragua had filed a complaint against both Honduras and Costa Rica with the International Court of Justice (World Court) in 1986, for allowing the contras to launch raids into Nicaragua from their territories. In a turning-point regional development, the heads of all five Central American states--Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua--met in Tela, Honduras, on 5-7 August 1989 and signed a declaration calling for the ""voluntary demobilization, repatriation or relocation"" of the contras in Nicaragua or in other countries within three months, beginning in September 1989, under the supervision of an international commission. On 7 August, too, in a bilateral agreement, Honduras agreed to the demobilization of the contras on its territory, in return for Nicaragua's withdrawal of its complaint against Honduras at the World Court.
Summary:
A crisis for Honduras was triggered by a Nicaraguan attack on several Honduran army posts on 9 September 1989. The Honduras Foreign Ministry protested the same day. On the 13th the head of Nicaragua's Military Intelligence responded that contra raids from Honduran bases had increased markedly in the preceding two weeks. (This turned out to be the only violent exchange during the crisis.)
In October, at the 43rd session of the UN General Assembly, the Honduras foreign minister called on the UN Secretary-General to create a multinational UN peacekeeping force to patrol the border with Nicaragua. The latter approved the idea. However, on 1 November President Ortega of Nicaragua declared a formal end to the cease-fire with the contras. This came in the aftermath of a contra attack on 22 October, in which 19 persons were killed....

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
The United States and Panama were enmeshed in a military intervention crisis from 15 December 1989 to 3 January 1990.
Background
 Washington played the decisive role in carving a sovereign state of Panama from Venezuela in 1903--in return for Panama's acceptance of U.S. construction and permanent control of the Panama Canal, linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This gave the U.S. an enduring strategic interest in the domestic and external affairs of a small state at the southern tip of Central America. U.S. ownership of the Panama Canal Zone ""in perpetuity"" attested to the U.S. perception of a vital interest.
The ""loss"" of the Canal Zone was deeply resented by Panama's political and military elites. That resentment was expressed during a brief January 1964 crisis triggered by the raising of the U.S. flag in the Canal Zone by U.S. students, in violation of a December 1963 banning of both states' flags at Canal Zone schools (see Case #206--Panama Flag crisis).
The U.S. and Panama agreed to renegotiate the 1903 treaties, after diplomatic relations were restored in April 1964. In June 1967 Presidents Johnson and Robles reached agreement on three treaties, but strong opposition prevented their consideration in, let alone ratification by, the U.S. Congress. General Omar Torrijos, who seized power in Panama in 1968, renounced the agreements. President Nixon resumed the negotiations in 1970, and a set of principles was agreed upon in 1974. Once more, strong opposition by right-wing Republicans aborted ratification.
Finally, after prolonged and acrimonious negotiations, President Carter secured the ratification of two integrally related U.S.-Panama treaties, one in April 1978 providing for the transfer of the Canal Zone to Panamanian sovereignty in the year 2000, the second in September 1979, guaranteeing the Canal's permanent neutral...

Begin Crisis Narrative
A crisis in the Iraq/Kuwait protracted conflict
Background:
Kuwait, the U.S., Iraq, and Sa'udi Arabia were the main participants in a crisis-war over the Gulf from 2 August 1990 to 12 April 1991. The other crisis actors were Bahrain, Egypt, France, Israel, Oman, Qatar, Syria, United Arab Emirates (UAE), the U.K., and the USSR.
Background
 Iraq's oil production, which was vital to its economy, declined drastically during the Iran/Iraq War from 1980 to 1988 (see Iran/Iraq PC). As a result Iraq was experiencing great difficulty in repaying loans received during that war from Arab states, notably Kuwait and the UAE, amounting to billions of dollars. Iraq requested cancellation of the debts; they refused.
Iraq expounded two arguments. One was that, in carrying the full human and material burden of war against Iran, it was defending the vital interests of all Arab states in the Gulf region against a fundamentalist regime intent on establishing its hegemony and taking control of their vast oil resources. The second was that these loans derived mainly from the large increase in their oil revenues due to the sharp reduction in Iraq's oil exports during the war years. For both reasons, argued Iraq, these ""loans"" should be regarded as contributions to a common war effort and should be canceled.
Pre-crisis
 President Saddam Hussein's verbal attacks on Kuwait and the UAE began at an Arab League meeting on 28 May 1990. He accused them of waging economic war against Iraq by overproducing oil and causing a collapse in world oil prices. On 17 July, a week after the Gulf states agreed to cut their oil production, Hussein threatened that ""if words fail to protect Iraq's interests, something effective must be done."" The next day Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, accused Kuwait of stealing a vast amount of oil from the southern section of the disputed Rumaila oil field since...

A crisis in the Yugoslavia protracted conflict
Background:
Yugoslavia (Serbia), Slovenia, and Croatia were embroiled in a grave crisis during the first phase of Yugoslavia's disintegration as a federal state, from 25 June 1991 to 3 January 1992.
Background
 The three main ethnic constituents of twentieth-century Yugoslavia were the products of varied historical experience. For Serbia, it was Greek Orthodox Christianity and five centuries of Turkish (Muslim) rule: the Serbs suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Kossovo in 1389, when Serbia became a vassal state of the Turks; and it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1459. Serbia reemerged as an independent state in 1878 as part of the peace settlement at the Congress of Berlin. Both the Slovenes and the Croats were predominantly Roman Catholic and fell within the cultural and political orbit of Central Europe, most recently as parts of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian empire from 1867 until its dissolution in 1918.
In the political vacuum created by World War I and the demise of the Dual Monarchy, the ""South Slavs"" united: on 4 December 1918 they proclaimed the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, with young King Peter of Serbia as its monarch and Prince Alexander as Regent. Alexander succeeded to the throne upon Peter's death in 1921 and ruled until he was assassinated in 1934 (see Case #46--Assassination of King Alexander). In 1929 he had proclaimed a dictatorship over the kingdom and renamed it Yugoslavia in a symbolic effort to eradicate the historic and ethnic divisions. Peter II served as king from 1934 to 1945, with power in the hands of Prince Paul as regent.
During World War II the Communist-led Yugoslav Partisans successfully resisted all German attempts to overrun Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1944....

Both the Slovenes and the Croats were predominantly Roman Catholic and fell within the cultural and political orbit of Central Europe, most recently as parts of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian empire from 1867 until its dissolution in 1918.
In the political vacuum created by World War I and the demise of the Dual Monarchy, the ""South Slavs"" united: on 4 December 1918 they proclaimed the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, with young King Peter of Serbia as its monarch and Prince Alexander as Regent. Alexander succeeded to the throne upon Peter's death in 1921 and ruled until he was assassinated in 1934 (see Case #46--Assassination of King Alexander). In 1929 he had proclaimed a dictatorship over the kingdom and renamed it Yugoslavia in a symbolic effort to eradicate the historic and ethnic divisions. Peter II served as king from 1934 to 1945, with power in the hands of Prince Paul as regent.
During World War II the Communist-led Yugoslav Partisans successfully resisted all German attempts to overrun Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1944....

A crisis in the Yugoslavia protracted conflict
Background:
Yugoslavia (Serbia), Slovenia, and Croatia were embroiled in a grave crisis during the first phase of Yugoslavia's disintegration as a federal state, from 25 June 1991 to 3 January 1992.
Background
 The three main ethnic constituents of twentieth-century Yugoslavia were the products of varied historical experience. For Serbia, it was Greek Orthodox Christianity and five centuries of Turkish (Muslim) rule: the Serbs suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Kossovo in 1389, when Serbia became a vassal state of the Turks; and it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1459. Serbia reemerged as an independent state in 1878 as part of the peace settlement at the Congress of Berlin. Both the Slovenes and the Croats were predominantly Roman Catholic and fell within the cultural and political orbit of Central Europe, most recently as parts of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian empire from 1867 until its dissolution in 1918.

A crisis in the Ecuador/Peru protracted conflict
Background:
Ecuador and Peru experienced another crisis over territory from 6 to 15 October 1991.
Background
 The most recent flare-up in this protracted conflict over territory occurred near a Peruvian border post on the Corrientes River in January 1984.
Pre-crisis
 Tension between the two disputants rose in August 1991. On 30 September, at the UN, Ecuador's President Rodrigo Borja urged that Pope John Paul II be invited to mediate the dispute. (A South American precedent existed--a Vatican-mediated agreement between Argentina and Chile in 1984 that resolved their dispute since the mid-nineteenth century over the ownership of islands in the Beagle Channel [see Cases #287, #295--Beagle Channel I, II, in 1977-78, 1978-79, in Americas: Non-PCs].) On 2 October Peru's Defense Minister, General Torres, reaffirmed Lima's ""trust"" in the 1942 Rio Protocol, which had allocated the vast area in dispute to Peru. He also accused Ecuador of establishing a military post on Peruvian territory. The charge was rejected the next day by Ecuador's Defense Minister, Jorge Feliz, in a ""we will not yield an inch"" statement. This was echoed on the 5th by President Fujimori of Peru.
Summary:
A crisis for Ecuador was triggered by a perceived overflight of its territory on 6 October 1991 on the part of a Peruvian helicopter gunship. Ecuador responded the same day by suspending bilateral talks on the border then under way. This triggered a crisis for Peru. The threat of a serious military confrontation led the other three members of the five-state Andean Pact--Bolivia, Colombia, and Venezuela (along with Ecuador and Peru)--to urge a peaceful solution on the 8th. Ecuador accepted this initiative the next day, but Peru did not, calling, as always...

Background:
An international crisis between Armenia and Azerbaijan, part of a lengthy, still-unresolved conflict over Nagornyy-Karabakh (N-K), erupted on 27 November 1991 and began to fade in mid-August 1992.
Background and Pre-crisis
 In the turmoil that followed the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917 (see Cases #1, #3--Russian Civil War I, II, in 1918-20, in Multiregional PCs: East/West), the southern regions of the czarist empire experienced a brief period of political independence: Georgia and Armenia declared their independence on 22 April 1918, Azerbaijan on 26 May 1918. By November 1920 the ""Red"" forces, freed by victory in the war against Poland (see Case #13--Polish/Russian War, in Poland/Russia PC), triumphed over the ""Whites"" in the south. Soviet-style governments were established in Georgia and Armenia, on 25 February and 2 April 1921. On 12 March 1922 the three regions were integrated into the Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became part of the newly created USSR on 30 December of that year. In December 1936, under the terms of the ""Stalin Constitution,"" each became an ""independent"" republic in the 11-member USSR. So they remained until the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991.
Despite its overwhelming Armenian Christian population, Nagornyy-Karabakh, an enclave within Azerbaijan, was incorporated into the overwhelmingly Muslim republic of Azerbaijan in July 1921. Although it acquired the status of an Autonomous Oblast (District) in June 1923, this sowed the seeds of a bitter conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which erupted in the late 1980s.

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
An international crisis between Armenia and Azerbaijan, part of a lengthy, still-unresolved conflict over Nagornyy-Karabakh (N-K), erupted on 27 November 1991 and began to fade in mid-August 1992.
Background and Pre-crisis
 In the turmoil that followed the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917 (see Cases #1, #3--Russian Civil War I, II, in 1918-20, in Multiregional PCs: East/West), the southern regions of the czarist empire experienced a brief period of political independence: Georgia and Armenia declared their independence on 22 April 1918, Azerbaijan on 26 May 1918. By November 1920 the ""Red"" forces, freed by victory in the war against Poland (see Case #13--Polish/Russian War, in Poland/Russia PC), triumphed over the ""Whites"" in the south. Soviet-style governments were established in Georgia and Armenia, on 25 February and 2 April 1921. On 12 March 1922 the three regions were integrated into the Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became part of the newly created USSR on 30 December of that year. In December 1936, under the terms of the ""Stalin Constitution,"" each became an ""independent"" republic in the 11-member USSR. So they remained until the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991.
Despite its overwhelming Armenian Christian population, Nagornyy-Karabakh, an enclave within Azerbaijan, was incorporated into the overwhelmingly Muslim republic of Azerbaijan in July 1921. Although it acquired the status of an Autonomous Oblast (District) in June 1923, this sowed the seeds of a bitter conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which erupted in the late 1980s.
It began with street protests in N-K in...

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
Egypt and Sudan experienced another crisis over a long-standing border dispute from late January to late June 1992.
Background
 The Hala'ib region of southeast Egypt along the Red Sea has long been a source of contention. The 1899 agreement between Egypt and the U.K., which established an Anglo-Egyptian condominium over Sudan, determined that the border between Egypt and Sudan was to run along a straight west-east line. However, for convenience, Sudan was given authority to administer the Hala'ib area, almost 20,000 square kilometers, north of the line, and Egypt, an area south of the line. Over time Sudan began to claim political and economic rights in the Hala'ib area, for example, the right of its residents to vote in Sudanese elections, and the right to exploit its economic resources. However, Sudan never openly challenged Egypt's sovereignty over this area. Until Sudan's independence in 1956 the issue never became a focus of conflict; and thereafter Egypt allowed Sudan to administer the area.
Overt conflict was rare. However, on one occasion, in February 1958, Egypt and Sudan were embroiled in a crisis over Cairo's attempt to take control of the area by force. Although it remained non-violent, troops were dispatched, and Sudan complained to the UN Secretary-General about Egypt's ""aggression"" (see Case #163--Egypt/Sudan Border I).
Summary:
A crisis for Egypt was triggered toward the end of January 1992 when Sudan granted a Canadian oil company a concession to explore for oil in Hala'ib. Egypt contested this right early in February by advising oil companies around the world that Sudan did not have the authority to sign exploration agreements on any land north of their political boundary as laid down in the 1899 condominium agreement. However, it expressed the hope to settle the dispute quietly and did not issue an official protest. Sudan, by contrast, argued that ""administrative"" rights included the right to utilize the area's potential economic resources.

A crisis in the Yugoslavia protracted conflict
Background:
Yugoslavia (Serbia), Bosnia, and Croatia (and powerful minorities, notably the Bosnian Serbs) were entangled in a lengthy crisis over the fate of Bosnia-Hercegovina as a political entity. It began on 3 March 1992 and ended on 21 November 1995.
Background and Pre-crisis
 The people of Bosnia-Hercegovina are, ethnically, part of the community of ""South Slavs,"" including Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, and Montenegrins. By the end of the tenth century the people of eastern Bosnia, like those of modern Serbia, had accepted eastern Orthodox Christianity, while those of western Bosnia, like the Croats and Slovenes, had embraced Roman Catholicism.
The historical background, too, is complex. Bosnians and Serbs fought side by side in the decisive Battle of Kossovo in 1389; and like Serbia, Bosnia became part of the Ottoman Empire. There was one notable difference, with consequences for the crises of the 1990s. During the five centuries of Turkish rule the religious composition of Bosnia changed drastically, partly because of the immigration of Turks, partly because of the conversion of many Bosnians to Islam. The result was that, at the time of Yugoslavia's dissolution, Muslims formed the largest religious-ethnic community in Bosnia, slightly more than half, compared to 31 percent for the Orthodox Serbs and 17 percent for the Catholic Croats.
Austria was given the right to occupy--but not to annex--Bosnia and Hercegovina in 1878, at the same time the major powers granted Serbia independence: Serbia's long-standing aspiration to control these two areas was rebuffed. More significantly, Bosnia and Hercegovina were annexed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in October 1908, generating undisguised anger in Russia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. That association lasted only a decade: with the dissol...

A crisis in the Yugoslavia protracted conflict
Background:
Yugoslavia (Serbia), Bosnia, and Croatia (and powerful minorities, notably the Bosnian Serbs) were entangled in a lengthy crisis over the fate of Bosnia-Hercegovina as a political entity. It began on 3 March 1992 and ended on 21 November 1995.
Background and Pre-crisis
 The people of Bosnia-Hercegovina are, ethnically, part of the community of ""South Slavs,"" including Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, and Montenegrins. By the end of the tenth century the people of eastern Bosnia, like those of modern Serbia, had accepted eastern Orthodox Christianity, while those of western Bosnia, like the Croats and Slovenes, had embraced Roman Catholicism.
The historical background, too, is complex. Bosnians and Serbs fought side by side in the decisive Battle of Kossovo in 1389; and like Serbia, Bosnia became part of the Ottoman Empire. There was one notable difference, with consequences for the crises of the 1990s. During the five centuries of Turkish rule the religious composition of Bosnia changed drastically, partly because of the immigration of Turks, partly because of the conversion of many Bosnians to Islam. The result was that, at the time of Yugoslavia's dissolution, Muslims formed the largest religious-ethnic community in Bosnia, slightly more than half, compared to 31 percent for the Orthodox Serbs and 17 percent for the Catholic Croats.
Austria was given the right to occupy--but not to annex--Bosnia and Hercegovina in 1878, at the same time the major powers granted Serbia independence: Serbia's long-standing aspiration to control these two areas was rebuffed. More significantly, Bosnia and Hercegovina were annexed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in October 1908, generating undisguised anger in Russia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. That association lasted only a decade: with the dissol...

More significantly, Bosnia and Hercegovina were annexed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in October 1908, generating undisguised anger in Russia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. That association lasted only a decade: with the dissol...

A crisis in the Yugoslavia protracted conflict
Background:
Yugoslavia (Serbia), Bosnia, and Croatia (and powerful minorities, notably the Bosnian Serbs) were entangled in a lengthy crisis over the fate of Bosnia-Hercegovina as a political entity. It began on 3 March 1992 and ended on 21 November 1995.
Background and Pre-crisis
 The people of Bosnia-Hercegovina are, ethnically, part of the community of ""South Slavs,"" including Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, and Montenegrins. By the end of the tenth century the people of eastern Bosnia, like those of modern Serbia, had accepted eastern Orthodox Christianity, while those of western Bosnia, like the Croats and Slovenes, had embraced Roman Catholicism.
The historical background, too, is complex. Bosnians and Serbs fought side by side in the decisive Battle of Kossovo in 1389; and like Serbia, Bosnia became part of the Ottoman Empire. There was one notable difference, with consequences for the crises of the 1990s. During the five centuries of Turkish rule the religious composition of Bosnia changed drastically, partly because of the immigration of Turks, partly because of the conversion of many Bosnians to Islam. The result was that, at the time of Yugoslavia's dissolution, Muslims formed the largest religious-ethnic community in Bosnia, slightly more than half, compared to 31 percent for the Orthodox Serbs and 17 percent for the Catholic Croats.
Austria was given the right to occupy--but not to annex--Bosnia and Hercegovina in 1878, at the same time the major powers granted Serbia independence: Serbia's long-standing aspiration to control these two areas was rebuffed.

A crisis in the Iraq Regime protracted conflict
Background:
Iraq experienced a post-Gulf War crisis from 18 August to 8 September 1992 over the ""no-fly zone"" imposed by the U.S., the U.K., and France.
Background and Pre-crisis
 Notwithstanding its military defeat in January-February 1991 (see Case #393--Gulf War), Iraq's regime continued a long-standing policy of repression against its Kurdish minority in the north and the Shia in the south. The victors in the war, led by the U.S., created ""safe havens"" for the Kurds in April 1991, following their failed rebellion against Saddam Hussein's regime and the mass flight--estimated at almost two million refugees--into the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan. That Western interventionist regime in northern Iraq was still in force, in a modified form, six years after the war.
The idea of a no-fly zone south of the 32nd Parallel emerged from reports in early August 1992 of increasing Iraqi military activity and violations of human rights among the Shia population in southern Iraq.
On 11 August, at a UN Security Council meeting convened at the request of France, the U.K., and the U.S., the UN rapporteur on human rights in Iraq reported that there was documentary evidence of a systematic policy by Iraq to destroy the Shia Arabs of the marshlands and their culture. The Council did not pass a resolution; but this meeting was perceived--by Iraq, the Western powers, and others--as a step toward enforcing Iraq's compliance with the provision of Security Council Resolution 688, passed at the end of the Gulf War, demanding that Iraq's regime cease suppressing its Kurdish and Shia minorities. On 12 August Iraq dismissed Mr. van der Stoel's report as ""inaccurate.""

On 18 August 1992 senior officials from France, the U.K., and the U.S. announced that they...

A crisis in the North Korea Nuclear protracted conflict
Background:
North Korea, South Korea, and the United States were enmeshed in a post-Cold War crisis over nuclear proliferation from early March 1993 until 21 October 1994.
Background and Pre-crisis
 The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) formally came into effect in 1970. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea) became a signatory in December 1985, part of the price for Soviet assistance in realizing its nuclear reactor program. As such, it undertook not to engage in activities that could lead to the production of nuclear weapons.
Further commitments were undertaken--by both Koreas--in their 1992 Denuclearization Agreement, notably a ban on the production of fissile material and the signing of a Joint Declaration on Denuclearization, an agreement in principle to establish a nuclear-free zone on the Korean peninsula. More tangibly, in the January 1992 IAEA Safeguards Agreement, the DPRK undertook to reveal the existence of 13 hitherto-unknown nuclear facilities and to permit regular inspections of North Korea's Yongbyon complex by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Notwithstanding these commitments, evidence of an incipient North Korean nuclear bomb program was reported by U.S. intelligence as early as February 1992.
Tension between the International Atomic Energy Agency and North Korea was endemic: the former, acting as the NPT's monitoring body, kept pressing for total access to the latter's nuclear facilities, while North Korea attempted to restrict access.
In February 1993 IAEA inspectors, on a routine check, discovered a substantive discrepancy between the amount of weapons-grade plutonium and the amount reported by North Korea to the IAEA. This created the setting for an impending crisis.

In early March 1993 the IAEA sought permission from the DPRK for a ""special inspection"" of two suspect, that...

Begin Crisis Narrative
A crisis in the North Korea Nuclear protracted conflict
Background:
North Korea, South Korea, and the United States were enmeshed in a post-Cold War crisis over nuclear proliferation from early March 1993 until 21 October 1994.
Background and Pre-crisis
 The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) formally came into effect in 1970. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea) became a signatory in December 1985, part of the price for Soviet assistance in realizing its nuclear reactor program. As such, it undertook not to engage in activities that could lead to the production of nuclear weapons.
Further commitments were undertaken--by both Koreas--in their 1992 Denuclearization Agreement, notably a ban on the production of fissile material and the signing of a Joint Declaration on Denuclearization, an agreement in principle to establish a nuclear-free zone on the Korean peninsula. More tangibly, in the January 1992 IAEA Safeguards Agreement, the DPRK undertook to reveal the existence of 13 hitherto-unknown nuclear facilities and to permit regular inspections of North Korea's Yongbyon complex by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Notwithstanding these commitments, evidence of an incipient North Korean nuclear bomb program was reported by U.S. intelligence as early as February 1992.
Tension between the International Atomic Energy Agency and North Korea was endemic: the former, acting as the NPT's monitoring body, kept pressing for total access to the latter's nuclear facilities, while North Korea attempted to restrict access.
In February 1993 IAEA inspectors, on a routine check, discovered a substantive discrepancy between the amount of weapons-grade plutonium and the amount reported by North Korea to the IAEA. This created the setting for an impending crisis.

In early March 1993 the IAEA sought permission from the DPRK for a ""special inspection"" of two suspect, that...

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
Nigeria and Cameroon were embroiled in another crisis over territory from the end of December 1993 until late November 1994.
Background
 The borderland area of Bakassi consists largely of Nigerian nationals, mostly fishers. However, Nigeria had no legal claim to the territory. An Anglo-German treaty in 1913 had assigned the territory to the then-British colony of Southern Cameroon. And in the postindependence period Nigeria acknowledged Cameroon's sovereignty in the 1975 Maroua treaty.
Summary:
A crisis for Nigeria was triggered at the end of December 1993 when Cameroonian troops raided the fishing village of Abana, killing six persons. Nigeria responded on 3 January by occupying Diamond and Djsbana, Cameroonian islands in an oil-producing sector of the Gulf of Guinea. That act catalyzed a crisis for Cameroon, which, in turn, responded by dispatching troops in an attempt to reassert its claim to the islands.
From that initial tit-for-tat exchange the crisis oscillated between expressions of conciliation and minor clashes. Thus, on 6 January 1994, Cameroon's President, Paul Biya, and Nigeria's Foreign Minister, Baba Gana Kingibe, met in a friendly atmosphere and decided to establish joint patrols in the disputed area. On 17 February there were renewed clashes. Ten days later a French military mission arrived in Cameroon under the terms of their 1974 defense agreement. Nigeria reacted angrily, its foreign minister attacking France on 2 March for internationalizing the dispute.
Crisis diplomacy intensified in March. Cameroon submitted the dispute to the International Court of Justice and requested both the UN Security Council and the OAU to mediate. It also accepted a mediation offer by Togo. The foreign ministers of Nigeria and Cameroon met on 9-10 March. Peaceful crisis management suffered a setback when Cameroon's president made the withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the islands a condition for a summit...

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
Nigeria and Cameroon were embroiled in another crisis over territory from the end of December 1993 until late November 1994.
Background
 The borderland area of Bakassi consists largely of Nigerian nationals, mostly fishers. However, Nigeria had no legal claim to the territory. An Anglo-German treaty in 1913 had assigned the territory to the then-British colony of Southern Cameroon. And in the postindependence period Nigeria acknowledged Cameroon's sovereignty in the 1975 Maroua treaty.
Summary:
A crisis for Nigeria was triggered at the end of December 1993 when Cameroonian troops raided the fishing village of Abana, killing six persons. Nigeria responded on 3 January by occupying Diamond and Djsbana, Cameroonian islands in an oil-producing sector of the Gulf of Guinea. That act catalyzed a crisis for Cameroon, which, in turn, responded by dispatching troops in an attempt to reassert its claim to the islands.
From that initial tit-for-tat exchange the crisis oscillated between expressions of conciliation and minor clashes. Thus, on 6 January 1994, Cameroon's President, Paul Biya, and Nigeria's Foreign Minister, Baba Gana Kingibe, met in a friendly atmosphere and decided to establish joint patrols in the disputed area. On 17 February there were renewed clashes. Ten days later a French military mission arrived in Cameroon under the terms of their 1974 defense agreement. Nigeria reacted angrily, its foreign minister attacking France on 2 March for internationalizing the dispute.
Crisis diplomacy intensified in March. Cameroon submitted the dispute to the International Court of Justice and requested both the UN Security Council and the OAU to mediate. It also accepted a mediation offer by Togo. The foreign ministers of Nigeria and Cameroon met on 9-10 March. Peaceful crisis management suffered a setback when Cameroon's president made the withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the islands a condition for a summit...

Background:
The United States and Haiti were embroiled in a crisis from mid-July to 15 October 1994.
Background and Pre-crisis
 For most of its history Haiti was ruled by a foreign power. It was a colony of Spain from the earliest days of European contact with the Americas at the end of the fifteenth century. It was ceded to France in 1697 and remained a French colony until a successful slave revolt and victory over a large French army sent by Napoleon, leading to independence in 1804.
After a century of Haiti's isolation, the U.S. became the hegemonial power. It began with the landing of marines in 1915 and an imposed treaty that made Haiti a political and financial protectorate of the United States, initially for 10 years and then extended to 1936. Thereafter Haiti was ruled by despots, notably the Duvaliers, father and son, from 1957 to 1990.
In the first democratic elections, held on 16 December 1990, Father Jean Bertrand Aristide, a left-wing Roman Catholic priest, was elected President. However, less than a year later (30 September 1991) he was ousted by a military junta headed by Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras. All attempts to restore Aristide to power failed, including an agreement to step down, brokered by the U.S. and signed by the junta on 3 July 1993 (Governors Island Agreement).
From 1991 to 1994 Haiti was characterized by brutal repression and violation of human rights, including the killing of 3,000 civilians by paramilitary ""death squads."" In desperation, Haitians sought refuge in the U.S.--on a massive scale: in one eight-day period, 1-9 July 1994, an estimated 12,300 ""boat people"" were rescued and sent to makeshift camps in Panama and then to the U...

A crisis in the Iraq/Kuwait protracted conflict
Background:
Kuwait, Sa'udi Arabia, the United States, and Iraq were enmeshed in another Gulf crisis from 7 October to 10 November 1994.
Pre-crisis
 During the years that followed the Gulf War the U.S., the U.K., Kuwait, and Sa'udi Arabia were steadfast in their determination to maintain the sanctions regime until Iraq had fully complied with all UN demands as set out in the 7 March 1991 resolution, including an explicit demand that Iraq recognize Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Russia and France adopted a softer line, calling for the gradual lifting of sanctions, primarily because they perceived major economic benefits from Iraq's return to the international community.
In late September 1994 President Saddam Hussein had to stop subsidizing food prices. This caused a large price increase that led to internal unrest in Iraq. Baghdad renewed its demand that UN sanctions be lifted on humanitarian grounds--Iraqi children were suffering the ill effects of malnutrition, and the population at large was experiencing the adverse effects of a persistent shortage of medicines and general medical services. Hussein warned that Iraq would retaliate if the Security Council, at its next scheduled meeting on 10 October, decided to renew economic sanctions, especially the oil embargo. In this atmosphere of escalating tension, very similar to the prelude to the 1990-91 Gulf crisis-war, Iraqi forces began to move toward Kuwait on 2 October. On the 4th Saddam Hussein condemned the U.S. insistence on retaining the sanctions, which continued to cripple the Iraqi economy.
Summary:
Iraq's deployment of troops near its border with Kuwait on 7 October 1994, estimated at 40,000-50,000, triggered a crisis for Kuwait and Sa'udi Arabia: it threatened their territorial integrity and rekindled memories of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait...

Begin Crisis Narrative
A crisis in the Iraq/Kuwait protracted conflict
Background:
Kuwait, Sa'udi Arabia, the United States, and Iraq were enmeshed in another Gulf crisis from 7 October to 10 November 1994.
Pre-crisis
 During the years that followed the Gulf War the U.S., the U.K., Kuwait, and Sa'udi Arabia were steadfast in their determination to maintain the sanctions regime until Iraq had fully complied with all UN demands as set out in the 7 March 1991 resolution, including an explicit demand that Iraq recognize Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Russia and France adopted a softer line, calling for the gradual lifting of sanctions, primarily because they perceived major economic benefits from Iraq's return to the international community.
In late September 1994 President Saddam Hussein had to stop subsidizing food prices. This caused a large price increase that led to internal unrest in Iraq. Baghdad renewed its demand that UN sanctions be lifted on humanitarian grounds--Iraqi children were suffering the ill effects of malnutrition, and the population at large was experiencing the adverse effects of a persistent shortage of medicines and general medical services. Hussein warned that Iraq would retaliate if the Security Council, at its next scheduled meeting on 10 October, decided to renew economic sanctions, especially the oil embargo. In this atmosphere of escalating tension, very similar to the prelude to the 1990-91 Gulf crisis-war, Iraqi forces began to move toward Kuwait on 2 October. On the 4th Saddam Hussein condemned the U.S. insistence on retaining the sanctions, which continued to cripple the Iraqi economy.
Summary:
Iraq's deployment of troops near its border with Kuwait on 7 October 1994, estimated at 40,000-50,000, triggered a crisis for Kuwait and Sa'udi Arabia: it threatened their territorial integrity and rekindled memories of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait...

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
Yemen and Eritrea experienced a crisis over three Red Sea islands from 15 to 31 December 1995.
Background and Pre-Crisis
A dispute between Yemen and Eritrea broke out in November 1995 over three Red Sea islands, in which a small Yemeni fishing community lived. Greater Hanish, the main island in a chain between the two states, is nearby one of the world's major shipping lanes, 100 miles north of the southern entrance to the Red Sea. Eritrea had laid claim to the islands on what it described as historical grounds, as it acknowledged that its forces had been based on the Red Sea islands since its 30-year war against Ethiopia, after which Eritrea won independence in 1993. The two states were concerned with establishing rights over fishing, tourism and mineral exploitation.
Eritrea claimed that Yemen first put troops on the Hanish islands in early November. Yemen contended that tension was raised after Eritrea ordered all Yemenis off the islands on 11 November. Eritrean naval patrols tried to land on the islands and Yemen increased its military presence there.
A senior delegation, including Eritrea's Foreign Minister Petros Solomon, and Resources Minister Saleh Meki, visited Yemen on 22 November in an attempt to resolve the dispute peacefully. A Yemeni delegation headed by Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime-Minister Abdul ali al-Karim al-Iryani held talks with Eritrean officials in Asmara on 7 December. The two countries agreed to resolve the dispute through diplomacy in a further round in Yemen.
Summary:
Eritrean forces attacked the Hanish islands on 15 December 1995 and captured the largest -- Hanish al kabir (Greater Hanish) -- after three days of fighting, involving warships and aircraft from both sides. That triggered a crisis for both states. The next day Yemen accused Eritrea of invading the islands in a ""treacherous act of aggression.""

A crisis in the Greece/Turkey protracted conflict
Background:
Greece and Turkey experienced another crisis in the Aegean Sea from 26 to 31 January 1996.
Background and Pre-Crisis
Several mini-crises over territory and resources in the Aegean Sea erupted between Greece and Turkey from 1976 onward (sea Cases #272, #349, #376 - Aegean Sea I, II, III). The two neighboring states failed to find a legal framework for regulating their disputes in shared waters, including the demarcation of the continental shelf and the extension of Greek territorial waters.
The uninhabited 10-acre island of Imia is located in the Dodecanese chain in the eastern Aegean, between the Greek island of Kalimos and the Turkish coast. Imia was used as a fishing station and a navigation guide. The most recent crisis between Greece and Turkey was over the sovereignty of Imia, recognized as Greek territory under the Paris 1947 convention, in which the Dodecanese islands were ceded to Greece by Italy after World War II in reward for Greece fighting against the Nazis. Italy had taken these islands from Turkey in 1932, but Turkey claimed the protocol that transferred sovereignty of the Dodecanes islands from Turkey to Italy was invalid because it had not been submitted to the League of Nations for registration.
Tension between Greece and Turkey was renewed on 26 December 1995, as a Turkish cargo boat, ""Figen Akat,"" ran aground on Imia in Greek territorial waters close to the Turkish coast. The ship's crew refused help from Greek officials, claiming that they were on Turkish soil, called ""The Kardak Rocks."" However, on 28 December the ship left with the help of the Greek authorities, and Turkey issued a letter of protest, contesting Greek jurisdiction over the island. The next day, Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also addressed a verbal note to the Embassy of Greece, asserting that the island constituted part of Turkish territory. On 10 January, Greece responded by claiming that its ""national so...

A crisis in the Arab/Israel protracted conflict
Background:
Israel and Lebanon experienced another violent crisis on both sides of their border from 9 to 27 April 1996.
Background and Pre-Crisis
From the beginning of 1996 Hizbullah increased its attacks against Israel's forces in its South Lebanon ""Security Zone."" US pressure led to Syria's criticism of Hizbullah attacks against Israeli civilians in the settlements near the northern border. Hizbullah then confined its operations to Israel's Defense Force (IDF), as agreed in July 1993, at the end of the ""Operation Accountability"" crisis (see Case #409). The IDF responded with retaliation raids into South Lebanon. The freezing of the Israel-Syria peace process at the beginning of 1996 and the anticipated elections in Israel later that year encouraged Iran, Syria and Hizbullah to escalate attacks against Israel (executed by Hizbullah, backed by Iran and Syria), in order to gain political leverage.
On 8 April 1996 Hizbullah announced that a Lebanese child was killed and three other persons were wounded in a bomb explosion in South Lebanon, for which the IDF and the South Lebanese Army (SLA) were blamed.
Summary:
A crisis for Israel was triggered on 9 April by a major Hizbullah attack against Kiryat Shmona in Israel's northern Galilee, in which 36 Israeli civilians were wounded by 30 ""Katyusha"" rockets. In the exchange of fire between the IDF and Hizbullah on the following day, four Israeli soldiers were killed. Israel's major response was an air attack against Hizbullah bases in South Lebanon and targets in Beirut on 11 April.
This retaliation, which catalyzed the flight of tens of thousands Lebanese from the south towards Beirut, triggered a crisis for Lebanon. In spite of Israel's declarations that it had no intention to confront Syrian forces or the Lebanese Army, two separate incidents occurred, in which one Leb...

Begin Crisis Narrative
A crisis in the Arab/Israel protracted conflict
Background:
Israel and Lebanon experienced another violent crisis on both sides of their border from 9 to 27 April 1996.
Background and Pre-Crisis
From the beginning of 1996 Hizbullah increased its attacks against Israel's forces in its South Lebanon ""Security Zone."" US pressure led to Syria's criticism of Hizbullah attacks against Israeli civilians in the settlements near the northern border. Hizbullah then confined its operations to Israel's Defense Force (IDF), as agreed in July 1993, at the end of the ""Operation Accountability"" crisis (see Case #409). The IDF responded with retaliation raids into South Lebanon. The freezing of the Israel-Syria peace process at the beginning of 1996 and the anticipated elections in Israel later that year encouraged Iran, Syria and Hizbullah to escalate attacks against Israel (executed by Hizbullah, backed by Iran and Syria), in order to gain political leverage.
On 8 April 1996 Hizbullah announced that a Lebanese child was killed and three other persons were wounded in a bomb explosion in South Lebanon, for which the IDF and the South Lebanese Army (SLA) were blamed.
Summary:
A crisis for Israel was triggered on 9 April by a major Hizbullah attack against Kiryat Shmona in Israel's northern Galilee, in which 36 Israeli civilians were wounded by 30 ""Katyusha"" rockets. In the exchange of fire between the IDF and Hizbullah on the following day, four Israeli soldiers were killed. Israel's major response was an air attack against Hizbullah bases in South Lebanon and targets in Beirut on 11 April.
This retaliation, which catalyzed the flight of tens of thousands Lebanese from the south towards Beirut, triggered a crisis for Lebanon. In spite of Israel's declarations that it had no intention to confront Syrian forces or the Lebanese Army, two separate incidents occurred, in which one Leb...

Begin Crisis Narrative
A crisis in the Iraq Regime protracted conflict
Background:
Between 31 August and 14 September 1996, the US and Iraq engaged in an international crisis, with significant involvement of Iran and Turkey.
Background and Pre-Crisis
Following the Gulf War and failed Kurdish uprising in 1991, substantial parts of northern and southern Iraq became UN-protected zones, in an effort to inhibit the Iraqi government from violently suppressing minority groups. One of the groups that the exclusion zones intended to protect were the Kurdish people in the north, who were divided amongst themselves, most notably between the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). In this rivalry, the KDP sought Iraqi support, while the PUK sought the support of Iran.
In July and August 1996, the Kurdish conflict escalated, and the PUK made considerable military advances, with the apparent direct support of Iran. In late August, the KDP formally requested the assistance of Iraqi forces to repel the PUK positions.
Summary:
On 31 August 1996, an estimated 40,000 Iraqi troops intervened in the Kurdish civil war, on the side of the KDP. Iraq's forces quickly advanced and gained control of Arbil, which had recently fallen under PUK control. The Iraqi advances took place north of the 36th parallel, which had been explicitly protected under the 1991 agreements. This triggered a crisis for the US, which had been the leader of the coalition that implemented the restrictions on Iraqi military activity.
The US immediately increased air sorties over Iraq, and on 1 September 1996 President Clinton announced that the US would aggressively respond to Iraq's breach of the agreements. From 3-4 September, the US conducted Operation Desert Strike, unilaterally bombing Iraqi military positions and air defense systems with apparent success. A reported 6 Iraqi's died in the attacks, with dozens of injuries. The US also extended the ""air exclusion zone"" in southern Iraq...

Begin Crisis Narrative
A crisis in the Korea protracted conflict
Background:
South and North Korea were enmeshed in another bilateral crisis from 18 September to 29 December 1996.
Background and Pre-Crisis
The Korean War ended on 27 July 1953 with an armistice (see Case #140 - Korean War III) but a formal peace agreement between the two Koreas remained elusive. Throughout the postwar period, both North and South Korea repeatedly affirmed their desire for reunification of the Korean peninsula. However, until 1972 there was no formal communication or contact between them. After several meetings that year, the two parties to this protracted conflict announced an agreement to work toward reunification and an end to hostilities. The process broke down a year later after South Korea's President Park Chung Hee announced Seoul would seek separate membership of the United Nations.
The Poplar Tree crisis (see Case #274) in 1976 accentuated the tension and mistrust between the two Koreas. In 1988, South Korean President Roh Tae Woo called for renewed efforts to promote exchanges, family reunification and inter-Korean trade. South Korean firms began to import North Korean goods soon afterward, and direct trade began in the autumn of 1990.
Roh's initiative renewed momentum for dialogue. In 1991, the two sides signed a joint declaration on denuclearization: it called for a bilateral nuclear inspection regime to verify denuclearization of the peninsula, but it was never implemented.
Hostilities continued to flare in the early1990s, culminating in the North Korea Nuclear Crisis of 1993-94 (see Case #408). An official from the North threatened to turn Seoul into a ""sea of fire"" after talks in 1994 collapsed. In early 1996, the US offered to arrange a meeting between North and South Korea in order to negotiate a formal peace agreement between the two. However, tension rose again as a result of the penetration of the South by a...

A crisis in the DRC (Zaire)-Rwanda protracted conflict
Background:
A rebellion in eastern Zaire led to another international crisis for Zaire and Rwanda, which escalated into an eight-month civil war in Zaire, from 8 October 1996 to 16 May 1997.
Background and Pre-Crisis
The Tutsi victory in the Rwandan civil war in 1994 ended in a predominantly Tutsi Patriotic Front government (FPR) in Rwanda, and bases of Rwandan Hutu refugees camps in the Kivu region in eastern Zaire. During 1996, the extremist Hutu Interahamwe militia, backed by the Zairean Armed Forces (FAZ), ousted thousands of Banyamulenge - ethnic Tutsis - from the Masisi region in North Kivu, in order to use the area for cross-border raids into Rwanda.
In the weeks prior to the crisis between Zaire and Rwanda, the Interahamwe militia tried to expel Banyamulenge forces from South Kivu, who were well armed and trained to fight back. In September 1996, fighting between the two ethnic groups flared up, and Zaire accused Rwanda of arming the Banyamulenge. Rwanda denied the charge.
In October, a major rebellion by the Banyamulenge in eastern Zaire, led by Laurent Kabila - the coordinator of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire-Congo (ADFL) - threatened the integrity of the state, whose president Mobutu Sese Seko had traveled to Switzerland for cancer treatment, and brought Rwanda and Zaire to the verge of war.
Summary:
On 8 October 1996, the deputy governor of South Kivu, Lwasi Ngabo, threatened to treat the Banyamulenge as rebels and to expel them unless they left Zaire in 6 days. As a result, about 1,000,000 Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi,...

A rebellion in eastern Zaire led to another international crisis for Zaire and Rwanda, which escalated into an eight-month civil war in Zaire, from 8 October 1996 to 16 May 1997.
Background and Pre-Crisis
The Tutsi victory in the Rwandan civil war in 1994 ended in a predominantly Tutsi Patriotic Front government (FPR) in Rwanda, and bases of Rwandan Hutu refugees camps in the Kivu region in eastern Zaire. During 1996, the extremist Hutu Interahamwe militia, backed by the Zairean Armed Forces (FAZ), ousted thousands of Banyamulenge - ethnic Tutsis - from the Masisi region in North Kivu, in order to use the area for cross-border raids into Rwanda.
In the weeks prior to the crisis between Zaire and Rwanda, the Interahamwe militia tried to expel Banyamulenge forces from South Kivu, who were well armed and trained to fight back. In September 1996, fighting between the two ethnic groups flared up, and Zaire accused Rwanda of arming the Banyamulenge. Rwanda denied the charge.
In October, a major rebellion by the Banyamulenge in eastern Zaire, led by Laurent Kabila - the coordinator of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire-Congo (ADFL) - threatened the integrity of the state, whose president Mobutu Sese Seko had traveled to Switzerland for cancer treatment, and brought Rwanda and Zaire to the verge of war.
Summary:
On 8 October 1996, the deputy governor of South Kivu, Lwasi Ngabo, threatened to treat the Banyamulenge as rebels and to expel them unless they left Zaire in 6 days. As a result, about 1,000,000 Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi,...

A crisis in the Iraq Regime protracted conflict
Background:
Iraq and the United States were engaged in the fourth crisis of the protracted conflict between the two states from 13 November 1997 through 23 February 1998.
Background
As one of the conditions of the ceasefire agreement that ended the Gulf War, UN Security Council Resolution 687 called for Iraq to give up all weapons-of-mass-destruction capability. This resolution called for the creation of the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) to oversee and assist with the elimination of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons programs, while the International Atomic Energy Agency was tasked with working with Iraq on dismantling its nuclear program.
While Iraq accepted the provisions of Res. 687 and the authority of UNSCOM in April 1991, it soon became clear that UNSCOM inspectors would experience many obstacles, including repeated efforts by the Iraqi government to deny inspectors access to suspected weapons sites. Between the summer of 1991 and the summer of 1997, the UN Security Council passed seven resolutions demanding that Iraq cooperate fully with UNCSOM inspectors and make clear and transparent efforts to destroy its chemical and biological weapons programs. (See UN Security Council Resolutions 699 (1991), 707 (1991), 715 (1991), 949 (1994), 1051 (1996), 1060 (1996), and 1115 (1997).) While UNSCOM's inspection efforts are repeatedly thwarted by the Iraqi government, inspectors did find sufficient evidence during this period to confirm global suspicions that Iraq had developed an offensive biological weapons program and that they had actively pursued chemical agents as well.
In early October 1997, Richard Butler, the Executive Chairman of UNSCOM, submitted to the Security Council the semi-annual review of the commission's work in Iraq. The report indicated that Iraqi officials continued to prevent inspections throughout the country and that Ira...
