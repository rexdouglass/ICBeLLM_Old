Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
Prolonged ethnic strife in Sri Lanka generated a crisis with India from 3 June to 30 July 1987.
Background
 The roots of this South Asian crisis lay in the one-way migration of Indian Tamils to Ceylon (later, Sri Lanka) during the extended period of British rule: from 1757 to 1947 in the Indo/Pakistani subcontinent, from 1796 to 1948 in Ceylon. During the nineteenth century Indian Tamils, pushed by the endemic poverty of their homeland, the South Indian province of Madras (later, Tamilnadu), and pulled by the opportunities for employment in the labor-intensive rubber plantations of Ceylon, migrated in large numbers. By the time of independence, the Hindu Tamils comprised approximately 20 percent of Ceylon's population, with a vast majority of Buddhist Sinhalese.
From the outset the Tamils, concentrated in the northern Jaffna Peninsula, perceived acute discrimination in all aspects of Sri Lanka's society, economy, and polity. Ethnic resentment erupted into open rebellion in 1983 under the leadership of the most militant and disciplined Tamil group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the LTTE, best known as ""the Tamil Tigers"" or ""the Tigers."" Their goal for more than a decade has been an independent state for the Tamils of Sri Lanka, the vast majority of whom reside in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
Pre-crisis
 There have been several escalation points in an increasingly bitter ethnic conflict. One was a large-scale offensive launched by Sri Lanka's armed forces against the Tamil Tigers on 26 May 1987, ""Operation Liberation."" Not for the first time, the plight of their ethnic and religious kin generated a massive pressure group in Tamilnadu, a state in south India, which urged the government of India to intervene on behalf of Sri Lanka's Tamils. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi...

Begin Crisis Narrative
A crisis in the Angola protracted conflict
Background:
Angola and South Africa were embroiled in another of their many cross-border crises from 3 October 1987 to 22 August 1988.
Summary:
A crisis for Angola was triggered by a South Africa Defence Forces attack on SWAPO bases in Angolan territory on 3 October 1987. This was one of a number of such intrusions by the SADF since 1978, noted above, part of Pretoria's continuing struggle to thwart SWAPO's attempt to create an independent state of Namibia in South African-controlled South-West Africa. For Angola the incursion posed a threat of grave damage. For South Africa, Angola's provision of sanctuary to SWAPO forces threatened its control over South-West Africa and, generally, its primacy in the southern African region.
Angola's initial response followed its behavior in earlier intrusions of this kind: it appealed to the UN Security Council. As in the past, the Council unanimously passed a resolution condemning South Africa's ""continued and intensified acts of aggression"" against Angola and called for the immediate, unconditional withdrawal of its forces from Angola's territory. However, it did not impose economic sanctions on Pretoria.
This routinized Security Council behavior did not, per se, catalyze a crisis for South Africa. The trigger occurred on 10 December, when Angola launched a counterattack against SADF units.
Serious clashes between the SADF and Angolan forces continued intermittently for months, intertwined with the ongoing civil war in Angola between the MPLA-led government and UNITA. The latter's leader, Jonas Savimbi, claimed on 12 November that his forces had repulsed a three-month offensive by government forces. In mid-December, the Head of the SADF, General Johan Geldenhuys, admitted for the first time that his troops were fighting alongside UNITA inside Angola. Government forces had the active backing of 2,000 Soviet military advisors and of a large Cuban contingent...

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
Laos and Thailand were enmeshed in another crisis over disputed territory from 3 November 1987 to 17 February 1988.
Pre-crisis
 In May 1987 Laos accused Thailand of massing troops close to the northern border, in order to protect illegal logging activities. Laos launched several attacks on Thai loggers, killing some of them.
Summary:
A crisis for Laos and Thailand was triggered simultaneously on 3 November 1987 when heavy fighting broke out in the disputed three village area (see Case #353--Three Village Border I). Laos claimed that the fighting began with Thai air and artillery attacks on Laotian soldiers in the Boten district of its Sayaboury Province. Thailand said it was attacking Laotian troops who had invaded the Chat Trakan district of its Phitsaulok Province.
Thailand's initial response was ""Operation Soi Dao,"" designed to clear the disputed region of Laotian troops. Its major response occurred on 15 December when Thai F5 fighter planes bombed Laotian positions in the region. Laos appealed to the UN Secretary-General to intervene; Perez de Cuellar offered his good offices.
As heavy fighting continued, Laos agreed on 28 December to a third round of border talks with Thailand. However, by mid-January 1988 Thailand claimed that it had reasserted control over 70 percent of the area around Hill 1428. Fighting intensified on 1-2 February, as Thai planes launched heavy strikes against Laotian troop positions.
Talks between the two states, aimed at ending the armed border conflict, began on 16 February in Bangkok. Laos was represented by the Chief of the General Staff of the Laotian People's Army, General Sisavat Keobounphan. Thailand sent General Chaovalit Yongchaiyut, the commander of the Thai army.

Background:
Kenya and Uganda experienced a brief border crisis from 14 to 28 December 1987.
Background
 Tension between these East African neighbors increased as a result of Uganda's decision in May 1987 to transport its coffee crop and fuel by its own national railroad, which was less expensive than the Kenyan road system. Kenya retaliated by imposing strict border controls on traffic from Uganda, which caused heavy delays. Uganda blamed Kenya for closing the border unilaterally.
Summary:
Both states perceived a crisis the same day, 14 December 1987. Ugandan troops reportedly crossed the border first, near the town of Busia, triggering a crisis for Kenya. In the clashes that ensued, which triggered a crisis for Uganda, 15 Ugandans were reportedly killed. On the 18th Kenya ordered Uganda's high commissioner to leave the country.
President Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya and President Museveni of Uganda met at the border town of Malaba on the 28th and agreed on a series of steps to ease the tension. Security forces were to be pulled back from the frontier by both sides and replaced by regular police. Moreover, the border was to be reopened to regular traffic. These conciliatory acts terminated the crisis.
There was no involvement by the UN, the OAU, the U.S., or the USSR in this crisis....

A crisis in the China/Vietnam protracted conflict
Background:
Vietnam and China were embroiled in a crisis over the Spratly Islands from 14 March until late April 1988.
Background
 The Spratlys and the South China Sea generally had long been part of the territorial domain of imperial China. Control by the ""Middle Kingdom,"" however, eroded along with its decline as the regional hegemon during the penetration of European powers into Southeast Asia in the sixteenth century. But the issue of sovereignty over the Spratlys remained dormant until the late nineteenth century.
France emerged as the dominant power in Indochina and the islands of the South China Sea, a status formalized in the France/Annam treaty of 1874. China was compelled to accept France's primacy following the defeat of its navy in the Sino/French war of 1884-85. Extending its influence southward from its Indochina colony, France sent a survey mission to the Spratlys in 1927 and formally annexed the islands in April 1930.
Japan emerged as the next claimant: with most of coastal China under Japan's control early in the Sino/Japanese war (see Case #56--Marco Polo Bridge, in 1937-38, in China/Japan PC), the Japanese navy occupied the Spratlys in March 1939. The Itu Aba Island within the Spratly archipelago became a submarine base for Japan's invasion of the Philippines in December 1941. And the Spratlys assisted the Japanese conquest of Southeast Asia.
At the end of World War II, (Republican) China reasserted its claim to the Spratlys. So too did France, now restored to control over Indochina. China established a military post on Itu Aba. In October 1950 the newly (formally) independent Vietnam proclaimed possession of France's maritime boundaries in the South China Sea, including the Spratlys. And with the end of French rule in 1956...

A crisis in the Iran/Iraq protracted conflict
Background:
Iran experienced its last intra-war crisis (IWC) of the eight-year Iran/Iraq War from 18 April to 8 August 1988.
Background
 The long war in the Gulf region began in September 1980 when Iraq invaded its neighbor (see Case #317). There were several IWCs in the following years (see Cases #335, #348, #361 in 1982, 1984, 1986). Both sides suffered heavy casualties. There was little change in the strategic balance. And for most of the time the protagonists were locked in a stalemate.
The key Iraqi port of al-Faw at the entrance to the long-disputed Shatt-al-Arab estuary (see Cases #172, #234), with a history of conflict over this waterway going back to the Ottoman period before World War I, had fallen to Iran on 9 February 1986. On 14 May 1986 Iraqi forces made their first land incursion into Iran since the battle for Khorramshahr in 1982.
Pre-crisis
 For the last two years of the war there was a renewed stalemate. Iraq's primary goal in this phase was to damage the Iranian economy, notably its oil exports. Iran's objectives were to punish Iraq as the initiator of the costly war, to oust Saddam Hussein from power in Baghdad, and to receive massive war reparations from Iraq. In light of these goals Iran rejected several Iraqi offers of a cease-fire, including one by Saddam Hussein in January 1987: on 12 February Ayatullah Khomeini declared that the war against Iraq was a ""Holy Crusade"" that could end only in victory. On 20 March 1988 Khomeini reaffirmed his determination to persist until final victory.

A crisis in the India/Pakistan protracted conflict
Background:
India and Pakistan were enmeshed in another crisis over Kashmir, compounded by a near-nuclear confrontation, from 14 January until late June 1990.
Background
 As noted, the India/Pakistan conflict over Jammu and Kashmir has persisted since the end of British rule on 15 August 1947, with a norm of high tension, a myriad of incidents, and two full-scale interstate crises (see Cases #119 and #216). There was also a Kashmir dimension to the crisis over Bangladesh (see Case #242).
All through the 1980s anti-India forces in the India-occupied part of Kashmir pressed their opposition to continued Indian rule by (often violent) acts of disobedience, including the taking of hostages, foreign and Indian.
Summary:
A fresh Kashmir crisis for India was triggered on 14 January 1990, when, after weeks of escalating sectarian violence in Kashmir, Pakistan's foreign office expressed ""deep concern over the deteriorating situation in Indian-occupied Kashmir."" As often in the past, India's external affairs ministry retorted the next day that Pakistan's statement was ""an unacceptable interference in India's internal affairs,"" catalyzing a crisis for Pakistan. Many escalation points were to follow, including on 21 January 1990 when Indian police opened fire and killed 50 pro-independence demonstrators in the Vale of Kashmir (known as the Gawkadal massacre).
The two foreign ministers met in Delhi on 21-23 January, without any breakthrough. On the 30th India's army chief of staff declared that India's troops were prepared to protect Kashmir's borders ""at any cost.""
From January to April 1990 Indian Kashmir witnessed violent anti-India demonstrations and brutal suppression by an expanded Indian police and military presence: hundreds of Kashmiris were killed. Evidence that Pakistan was providing paramilitary...

A crisis in the Iraq/Kuwait protracted conflict
Background:
Kuwait, the U.S., Iraq, and Sa'udi Arabia were the main participants in a crisis-war over the Gulf from 2 August 1990 to 12 April 1991. The other crisis actors were Bahrain, Egypt, France, Israel, Oman, Qatar, Syria, United Arab Emirates (UAE), the U.K., and the USSR.
Background
 Iraq's oil production, which was vital to its economy, declined drastically during the Iran/Iraq War from 1980 to 1988 (see Iran/Iraq PC). As a result Iraq was experiencing great difficulty in repaying loans received during that war from Arab states, notably Kuwait and the UAE, amounting to billions of dollars. Iraq requested cancellation of the debts; they refused.
Iraq expounded two arguments. One was that, in carrying the full human and material burden of war against Iran, it was defending the vital interests of all Arab states in the Gulf region against a fundamentalist regime intent on establishing its hegemony and taking control of their vast oil resources. The second was that these loans derived mainly from the large increase in their oil revenues due to the sharp reduction in Iraq's oil exports during the war years. For both reasons, argued Iraq, these ""loans"" should be regarded as contributions to a common war effort and should be canceled.
Pre-crisis
 President Saddam Hussein's verbal attacks on Kuwait and the UAE began at an Arab League meeting on 28 May 1990. He accused them of waging economic war against Iraq by overproducing oil and causing a collapse in world oil prices. On 17 July, a week after the Gulf states agreed to cut their oil production, Hussein threatened that ""if words fail to protect Iraq's interests, something effective must be done."" The next day Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, accused Kuwait of stealing a vast amount of oil from the southern section of the disputed Rumaila oil field since...

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
Rwanda experienced an ethnic crisis with Uganda from 30 September 1990 to 29 March 1991.
Background
 Ethnic conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi communities has been endemic in Rwanda (and neighboring Burundi) since long before independence in July 1962. Until a successful Hutu revolt in 1959 the Tutsi dominated politics and the military. Thousands of Rwanda Tutsi fled to nearby states, Burundi, the Congo (later, Zaire), Tanganyika (later, Tanzania), and, most important, Uganda. It was in Uganda that thousands of Tutsi refugees organized themselves into a disciplined armed force, the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), with the goal of regaining power in Rwanda. (They ultimately did so, at the end of a lengthy civil war and in the aftermath of the 1994 Hutu-organized genocide against the members of the Tutsi community who had not fled Rwanda.)
Summary:
A crisis for Rwanda was triggered on 30 September 1990 by an RPF incursion from its bases in Uganda that threatened the Hutu-dominated regime of President Juvenal Habyarimana. Inconclusive clashes in the capital, Kigali, occurred on 4-5 October.
Rwanda's initial response was to arrest 3,000 members of the Tutsi community, eliciting expressions of concern from Belgium and the U.S. A cease-fire, brokered under the auspices of Belgium, took effect on the 24th but collapsed quickly. Fighting resumed near the Rwanda/Uganda border in late October and, after a lull, again on 12 December and on 4 and 23 January 1991--there were further incursions by the RPF from across the Uganda border.
On several occasions Rwanda accused the Uganda army of assisting the RPF, a charge that was always denied.

Background:
Sierra Leone experienced a foreign policy crisis from 23 March to 31 October 1991.
Background
 Sierra Leone's crisis was a direct spillover from Liberia's lengthy, complex civil war, which began in 1989. Several groups vied for power in a conflict that wrecked havoc in Africa's oldest independent state: President Samuel Doe, backed by Liberia's army; the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), led by Charles Taylor; and a small rebel armed group controlled by Prince Yormie Johnson. After Doe's murder on 11 September 1990, the remnants of his forces came under the command of Nimely David, head of the presidential guard. Moreover, there was an interim government of Liberia headed by Amos Sawyer, an academic and lawyer, based in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone; and there also was the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO), also based in Freetown and supported by Libya.
Summary:
A crisis for Sierra Leone was triggered on 23 March 1991 when 25 people were killed on its territory in a cross-border raid by Taylor's troops. Burkina Faso, which provided the NPFL with military and logistical assistance, was perceived as the source of threat to its territory by Sierra Leone's President, Joseph Saidu Momoh.
Sierra Leone responded at once by dispatching 2,000 troops to the border area; and on 31 March they occupied part of Lofa County in Liberia. Heavy fighting in April and May led to the killing of an estimated 3,000-5,000 Sierra Leone civilians and Liberian refugees by the NPFL--which denied any involvement. By mid-May NPFL forces had penetrated 150 kilometers into Sierra Leone's territory.
The first of four summit meetings held by ECOWAS, intended to terminate Liberia's civil war, were held on 30 June at Yammoussoukro in the Ivory Coast...

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
Ghana experienced a crisis with Togo from 11 April to 5 October 1991.
Background
 The relations between these west African neighbors had been strained for more than 30 years. Opponents of various regimes in Togo had sought refuge in Ghana.
Summary:
A crisis for Ghana was triggered on 11 April 1991, when Togolese soldiers threatened to fire at demonstrators who had fled across the border to Ghana. Togo closed the border and increased its military presence there. Ghana's Foreign Minister, Obed Asamoah, criticized Togo's behavior as designed to create an international incident, to enable Togo to seek outside help to solve serious internal problems: Togo was then experiencing mounting street violence, strikes, and harsh repression of all dissent by its security forces.
To avert a serious spillover from Togo's domestic crisis, Ghana's defense forces were placed on alert, to intervene if the safety of Ghanaians in Lomé, Togo's nearby capital, came under threat. Several cross-border violent incidents occurred; but a major confrontation between the armed forces of the two states was avoided. The low-intensity crisis continued until 5 October, when Ghana and Togo agreed to reopen their frontier....

A crisis in the Yugoslavia protracted conflict
Background:
Yugoslavia (Serbia), Slovenia, and Croatia were embroiled in a grave crisis during the first phase of Yugoslavia's disintegration as a federal state, from 25 June 1991 to 3 January 1992.
Background
 The three main ethnic constituents of twentieth-century Yugoslavia were the products of varied historical experience. For Serbia, it was Greek Orthodox Christianity and five centuries of Turkish (Muslim) rule: the Serbs suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Kossovo in 1389, when Serbia became a vassal state of the Turks; and it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1459. Serbia reemerged as an independent state in 1878 as part of the peace settlement at the Congress of Berlin. Both the Slovenes and the Croats were predominantly Roman Catholic and fell within the cultural and political orbit of Central Europe, most recently as parts of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian empire from 1867 until its dissolution in 1918.
In the political vacuum created by World War I and the demise of the Dual Monarchy, the ""South Slavs"" united: on 4 December 1918 they proclaimed the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, with young King Peter of Serbia as its monarch and Prince Alexander as Regent. Alexander succeeded to the throne upon Peter's death in 1921 and ruled until he was assassinated in 1934 (see Case #46--Assassination of King Alexander). In 1929 he had proclaimed a dictatorship over the kingdom and renamed it Yugoslavia in a symbolic effort to eradicate the historic and ethnic divisions. Peter II served as king from 1934 to 1945, with power in the hands of Prince Paul as regent.
During World War II the Communist-led Yugoslav Partisans successfully resisted all German attempts to overrun Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1944....

Background:
Zaire, along with Belgium and France, was enmeshed in a crisis arising from internal turmoil from 23 September to 4 November 1991.
Background
 The former Belgian Congo became independent on 30 June 1960 and was almost immediately confronted with an international crisis triggered by a mutiny among its soldiers (see Case #176). The occupation of Stanleyville by rebel forces and the formation of a Revolutionary Council on 4 August 1964 led to another Congo crisis with high-profile foreign military intervention (see Case #211). In November 1965 Colonel Mobutu seized power in a coup d'état--and remains Head of State in Zaire (formerly Congo) 32 years later.
Summary:
As in 1960 and 1964 a crisis for Zaire, Belgium, and France was triggered by an internal challenge on 23 September 1991: the catalyst was rioting by regular troops of Zaire's army and their occupation of Kinshasa Airport, in protest against low wages. The Mobutu regime correctly perceived this as a serious threat to Zaire's political system. For France and Belgium, as for Belgium and other states in the two earlier crises in the Congo, turmoil in Zaire's army posed a threat to influence in this raw material-rich state, the largest in central Africa.
Belgium and France responded on the 24th by announcing their intention to dispatch troops to Zaire to protect and evacuate foreign (Western) residents.
The next day President Mobutu termed the riots in Kinshasa the worst since those that accompanied the coming of independence, in July 1960. Opposition parties, which protested against impending foreign intervention, proposed Etienne Tsisekedi as Premier of a ""public salvation government"" to cope with the riots. Mobutu acquiesced on 30 September, under pressure from the U.S., France, and Belgium. And on 3 October the newly appointed premier, in open opposition to the president's policy, asked France and Belgium not to withdraw their troops prematurely...

A crisis in the Yugoslavia protracted conflict
Background:
Yugoslavia (Serbia), Bosnia, and Croatia (and powerful minorities, notably the Bosnian Serbs) were entangled in a lengthy crisis over the fate of Bosnia-Hercegovina as a political entity. It began on 3 March 1992 and ended on 21 November 1995.
Background and Pre-crisis
 The people of Bosnia-Hercegovina are, ethnically, part of the community of ""South Slavs,"" including Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, and Montenegrins. By the end of the tenth century the people of eastern Bosnia, like those of modern Serbia, had accepted eastern Orthodox Christianity, while those of western Bosnia, like the Croats and Slovenes, had embraced Roman Catholicism.
The historical background, too, is complex. Bosnians and Serbs fought side by side in the decisive Battle of Kossovo in 1389; and like Serbia, Bosnia became part of the Ottoman Empire. There was one notable difference, with consequences for the crises of the 1990s. During the five centuries of Turkish rule the religious composition of Bosnia changed drastically, partly because of the immigration of Turks, partly because of the conversion of many Bosnians to Islam. The result was that, at the time of Yugoslavia's dissolution, Muslims formed the largest religious-ethnic community in Bosnia, slightly more than half, compared to 31 percent for the Orthodox Serbs and 17 percent for the Catholic Croats.
Austria was given the right to occupy--but not to annex--Bosnia and Hercegovina in 1878, at the same time the major powers granted Serbia independence: Serbia's long-standing aspiration to control these two areas was rebuffed. More significantly, Bosnia and Hercegovina were annexed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in October 1908, generating undisguised anger in Russia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. That association lasted only a decade: with the dissol...

A crisis in the Yugoslavia protracted conflict
Background:
Yugoslavia (Serbia), Bosnia, and Croatia (and powerful minorities, notably the Bosnian Serbs) were entangled in a lengthy crisis over the fate of Bosnia-Hercegovina as a political entity. It began on 3 March 1992 and ended on 21 November 1995.
Background and Pre-crisis
 The people of Bosnia-Hercegovina are, ethnically, part of the community of ""South Slavs,"" including Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, and Montenegrins. By the end of the tenth century the people of eastern Bosnia, like those of modern Serbia, had accepted eastern Orthodox Christianity, while those of western Bosnia, like the Croats and Slovenes, had embraced Roman Catholicism.
The historical background, too, is complex. Bosnians and Serbs fought side by side in the decisive Battle of Kossovo in 1389; and like Serbia, Bosnia became part of the Ottoman Empire. There was one notable difference, with consequences for the crises of the 1990s. During the five centuries of Turkish rule the religious composition of Bosnia changed drastically, partly because of the immigration of Turks, partly because of the conversion of many Bosnians to Islam. The result was that, at the time of Yugoslavia's dissolution, Muslims formed the largest religious-ethnic community in Bosnia, slightly more than half, compared to 31 percent for the Orthodox Serbs and 17 percent for the Catholic Croats.
Austria was given the right to occupy--but not to annex--Bosnia and Hercegovina in 1878, at the same time the major powers granted Serbia independence: Serbia's long-standing aspiration to control these two areas was rebuffed. More significantly, Bosnia and Hercegovina were annexed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in October 1908, generating undisguised anger in Russia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. That association lasted only a decade: with the dissol...

A crisis in the Iraq Regime protracted conflict
Background:
Iraq experienced a post-Gulf War crisis from 18 August to 8 September 1992 over the ""no-fly zone"" imposed by the U.S., the U.K., and France.
Background and Pre-crisis
 Notwithstanding its military defeat in January-February 1991 (see Case #393--Gulf War), Iraq's regime continued a long-standing policy of repression against its Kurdish minority in the north and the Shia in the south. The victors in the war, led by the U.S., created ""safe havens"" for the Kurds in April 1991, following their failed rebellion against Saddam Hussein's regime and the mass flight--estimated at almost two million refugees--into the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan. That Western interventionist regime in northern Iraq was still in force, in a modified form, six years after the war.
The idea of a no-fly zone south of the 32nd Parallel emerged from reports in early August 1992 of increasing Iraqi military activity and violations of human rights among the Shia population in southern Iraq.
On 11 August, at a UN Security Council meeting convened at the request of France, the U.K., and the U.S., the UN rapporteur on human rights in Iraq reported that there was documentary evidence of a systematic policy by Iraq to destroy the Shia Arabs of the marshlands and their culture. The Council did not pass a resolution; but this meeting was perceived--by Iraq, the Western powers, and others--as a step toward enforcing Iraq's compliance with the provision of Security Council Resolution 688, passed at the end of the Gulf War, demanding that Iraq's regime cease suppressing its Kurdish and Shia minorities. On 12 August Iraq dismissed Mr. van der Stoel's report as ""inaccurate.""

A crisis in the North Korea Nuclear protracted conflict
Background:
North Korea, South Korea, and the United States were enmeshed in a post-Cold War crisis over nuclear proliferation from early March 1993 until 21 October 1994.
Background and Pre-crisis
 The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) formally came into effect in 1970. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea) became a signatory in December 1985, part of the price for Soviet assistance in realizing its nuclear reactor program. As such, it undertook not to engage in activities that could lead to the production of nuclear weapons.
Further commitments were undertaken--by both Koreas--in their 1992 Denuclearization Agreement, notably a ban on the production of fissile material and the signing of a Joint Declaration on Denuclearization, an agreement in principle to establish a nuclear-free zone on the Korean peninsula. More tangibly, in the January 1992 IAEA Safeguards Agreement, the DPRK undertook to reveal the existence of 13 hitherto-unknown nuclear facilities and to permit regular inspections of North Korea's Yongbyon complex by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Notwithstanding these commitments, evidence of an incipient North Korean nuclear bomb program was reported by U.S. intelligence as early as February 1992.
Tension between the International Atomic Energy Agency and North Korea was endemic: the former, acting as the NPT's monitoring body, kept pressing for total access to the latter's nuclear facilities, while North Korea attempted to restrict access.
In February 1993 IAEA inspectors, on a routine check, discovered a substantive discrepancy between the amount of weapons-grade plutonium and the amount reported by North Korea to the IAEA. This created the setting for an impending crisis.
Summary:
In early March 1993 the IAEA sought permission from the DPRK for a ""special inspection"" of two suspect, that...

A crisis in the Arab/Israel protracted conflict
Background:
Israel and Lebanon were embroiled in a crisis from 10 to 31 July 1993.
Background
 Low-intensity violence has been the norm in Israel/Lebanon relations since the failed ""Litani Operation"" by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in March 1978. During its 1982 ""Peace for Galilee"" campaign, that is, the Lebanon War, Israel created a ""security zone"" in south Lebanon to protect its northern towns and settlements from frequent shelling by hostile forces, notably from several factions within the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) or the Iranian-backed Hizbullah (""Party of God""). These raids intensified during the Intifada (the Uprising) by Palestinians against Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from December 1987 until the signing of the Israel/PLO Oslo Accord in August 1993. There were frequent raids and retaliations across the Israel/Lebanon border--by both sides. One of these escalated to a full-scale crisis in 1993.
Summary:
A crisis for Israel was triggered on 10 July by a Hizbullah attack in the security zone that killed five IDF soldiers and wounded many others. Israel's initial response was a public demand by Prime Minister Rabin the same day that Syria curb the activities of the Hizbullah, whose headquarters were located in the Biqa Valley of Lebanon, where Syria held sway. Simultaneously Israel deployed more troops and firepower to its border with Lebanon.
On 19 July, after another Hizbullah attack in which several Israeli soldiers were wounded, the IDF was authorized to take whatever steps were necessary to protect the northern border. Rabin, who also held the Defense portfolio, issued another warning to both Syria and the Hizbullah. Another Israeli soldier was killed on the 23rd. Two days later came Israel's major response, the launching of ""Operation Accountability."" Heavy air raids and intense artillery attacks on south...

A crisis in the Iraq/Kuwait protracted conflict
Background:
Kuwait, Sa'udi Arabia, the United States, and Iraq were enmeshed in another Gulf crisis from 7 October to 10 November 1994.
Pre-crisis
 During the years that followed the Gulf War the U.S., the U.K., Kuwait, and Sa'udi Arabia were steadfast in their determination to maintain the sanctions regime until Iraq had fully complied with all UN demands as set out in the 7 March 1991 resolution, including an explicit demand that Iraq recognize Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Russia and France adopted a softer line, calling for the gradual lifting of sanctions, primarily because they perceived major economic benefits from Iraq's return to the international community.
In late September 1994 President Saddam Hussein had to stop subsidizing food prices. This caused a large price increase that led to internal unrest in Iraq. Baghdad renewed its demand that UN sanctions be lifted on humanitarian grounds--Iraqi children were suffering the ill effects of malnutrition, and the population at large was experiencing the adverse effects of a persistent shortage of medicines and general medical services. Hussein warned that Iraq would retaliate if the Security Council, at its next scheduled meeting on 10 October, decided to renew economic sanctions, especially the oil embargo. In this atmosphere of escalating tension, very similar to the prelude to the 1990-91 Gulf crisis-war, Iraqi forces began to move toward Kuwait on 2 October. On the 4th Saddam Hussein condemned the U.S. insistence on retaining the sanctions, which continued to cripple the Iraqi economy.
Summary:

A crisis in the Ecuador/Peru protracted conflict
Background:
The most recent crisis between Ecuador and Peru over their disputed border occurred from 9 January to 28 February 1995.
Background
In January 1995, violence erupted once more over an undemarcated 78 km stretch of the Ecuador/Peru border that is reputed to contain gold, uranium and, possibly, oil deposits.
Summary:
Armed clashes between Ecuador and Peru began on 9 January 1995, although it is unclear as to which side fired first. Fighting intensified on 26 January. The next day, Ecuadorean President Sixto Durin Ballen proclaimed a state of emergency. Both armies called up reserves; and Peru's President Alberto Fujimori reportedly began to personally direct the military operation. The fighting was escalated further between 27 and 29 January. On the 29th President Durin claimed that Peru had opened a massive attack on four Ecuadorean bases, and an Ecuadorian communiqué claimed that a Peruvian helicopter had been shot down.
On 31 January officials from the two states jointly announced a cease-fire, following talks in Rio de Janeiro that were mediated by the guarantors of the 1942 Rio Protocol - the US, Argentina, Brazil and Chile. On 3 February negotiators for Peru and Ecuador reached an accord, to be submitted to their respective governments. However, fighting resumed in early February and seriously escalated on the 10th, when Peru launched heavy air attacks on Ecuadorean positions along the Cenepa river. Three Peruvian aircraft were shot down during the attacks. The US and Brazil announced that they were suspending all arms shipments to the two adversaries.
On 17 February the deputy foreign ministers of Peru (Eduardo Ponce Vivanco) and Ecuador (Marcelo Fernandez Cordoba) and representatives of the Rio Protocol guarantors signed a peace declaration at the Itamaraty Palace in Brasilia. Ecuador and Peru accepted the guarantor countries' offer to send obser...

A crisis in the Taiwan Strait protracted conflict
Background:
The fifth crisis in the protracted Taiwan Straits conflict began on 22 May 1995 and lasted until 25 March 1996. The Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) were both crisis actors.
Background and Pre-Crisis
While a fundamental disagreement persisted between the PRC and the ROC about the potential independence of Taiwan, leaders of both countries made efforts in 1995 to ease tensions between the two actors. In a New Year's Day address, Chinese President Jiang Zemin had called for a peaceful resolution to the dispute between Beijing and Taipei, encouraging leaders in both capitals to work toward a mutually acceptable ""one country, two systems"" framework. In April 1995, Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui responded to Jiang's statement with a call for greater economic cooperation between China and Taiwan and establishment of regular dispute resolution mechanisms for disagreements between the two. Optimism that these statements might lead to direct talks between Jiang and Lee receded in late April when Jiang noted that the conditions were not yet ripe for a summit meeting between the two leaders. Days later, scheduled working-level cross-strait talks were cancelled after representatives from both sides could not agree on an agenda for the meeting.
At the same time, Taiwanese officials were at work trying to secure a visa to allow President Lee to come to the United States to visit his alma mater (Cornell University in New York state). On 7 April, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher assured Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that, consistent with its long-standing policy, the US would not issue such a visa to the Taiwanese leader. Christopher warned Qian, though, that legislators in the US were pressuring the Clinton administration to allow Lee to visit. Officials in Beijing were especially concerned that a visit by Lee to the US would be a catalyst to a renewed and aggressive campaign by Taipei for an independent Taiwan, especially in light of Taiwan's upcoming presidential elections, in which Lee was hoping to become the first democratically elected...

A crisis in the Greece/Turkey protracted conflict
Background:
Greece and Turkey experienced another crisis in the Aegean Sea from 26 to 31 January 1996.
Background and Pre-Crisis
Several mini-crises over territory and resources in the Aegean Sea erupted between Greece and Turkey from 1976 onward (sea Cases #272, #349, #376 - Aegean Sea I, II, III). The two neighboring states failed to find a legal framework for regulating their disputes in shared waters, including the demarcation of the continental shelf and the extension of Greek territorial waters.
The uninhabited 10-acre island of Imia is located in the Dodecanese chain in the eastern Aegean, between the Greek island of Kalimos and the Turkish coast. Imia was used as a fishing station and a navigation guide. The most recent crisis between Greece and Turkey was over the sovereignty of Imia, recognized as Greek territory under the Paris 1947 convention, in which the Dodecanese islands were ceded to Greece by Italy after World War II in reward for Greece fighting against the Nazis. Italy had taken these islands from Turkey in 1932, but Turkey claimed the protocol that transferred sovereignty of the Dodecanes islands from Turkey to Italy was invalid because it had not been submitted to the League of Nations for registration.
Tension between Greece and Turkey was renewed on 26 December 1995, as a Turkish cargo boat, ""Figen Akat,"" ran aground on Imia in Greek territorial waters close to the Turkish coast. The ship's crew refused help from Greek officials, claiming that they were on Turkish soil, called ""The Kardak Rocks."" However, on 28 December the ship left with the help of the Greek authorities, and Turkey issued a letter of protest, contesting Greek jurisdiction over the island. The next day, Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also addressed a verbal note to the Embassy of Greece, asserting that the island constituted part of Turkish territory. On 10 January, Greece responded by claiming that its ""national so...

A crisis in the Arab/Israel protracted conflict
Background:
Israel and Lebanon experienced another violent crisis on both sides of their border from 9 to 27 April 1996.
Background and Pre-Crisis
From the beginning of 1996 Hizbullah increased its attacks against Israel's forces in its South Lebanon ""Security Zone."" US pressure led to Syria's criticism of Hizbullah attacks against Israeli civilians in the settlements near the northern border. Hizbullah then confined its operations to Israel's Defense Force (IDF), as agreed in July 1993, at the end of the ""Operation Accountability"" crisis (see Case #409). The IDF responded with retaliation raids into South Lebanon. The freezing of the Israel-Syria peace process at the beginning of 1996 and the anticipated elections in Israel later that year encouraged Iran, Syria and Hizbullah to escalate attacks against Israel (executed by Hizbullah, backed by Iran and Syria), in order to gain political leverage.
On 8 April 1996 Hizbullah announced that a Lebanese child was killed and three other persons were wounded in a bomb explosion in South Lebanon, for which the IDF and the South Lebanese Army (SLA) were blamed.
Summary:
A crisis for Israel was triggered on 9 April by a major Hizbullah attack against Kiryat Shmona in Israel's northern Galilee, in which 36 Israeli civilians were wounded by 30 ""Katyusha"" rockets. In the exchange of fire between the IDF and Hizbullah on the following day, four Israeli soldiers were killed. Israel's major response was an air attack against Hizbullah bases in South Lebanon and targets in Beirut on 11 April.
This retaliation, which catalyzed the flight of tens of thousands Lebanese from the south towards Beirut, triggered a crisis for Lebanon. In spite of Israel's declarations that it had no intention to confront Syrian forces or the Lebanese Army, two separate incidents occurred, in which one Leb...

A crisis in the Iraq Regime protracted conflict
Background:
Between 31 August and 14 September 1996, the US and Iraq engaged in an international crisis, with significant involvement of Iran and Turkey.
Background and Pre-Crisis
Following the Gulf War and failed Kurdish uprising in 1991, substantial parts of northern and southern Iraq became UN-protected zones, in an effort to inhibit the Iraqi government from violently suppressing minority groups. One of the groups that the exclusion zones intended to protect were the Kurdish people in the north, who were divided amongst themselves, most notably between the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). In this rivalry, the KDP sought Iraqi support, while the PUK sought the support of Iran.
In July and August 1996, the Kurdish conflict escalated, and the PUK made considerable military advances, with the apparent direct support of Iran. In late August, the KDP formally requested the assistance of Iraqi forces to repel the PUK positions.
Summary:
On 31 August 1996, an estimated 40,000 Iraqi troops intervened in the Kurdish civil war, on the side of the KDP. Iraq's forces quickly advanced and gained control of Arbil, which had recently fallen under PUK control. The Iraqi advances took place north of the 36th parallel, which had been explicitly protected under the 1991 agreements. This triggered a crisis for the US, which had been the leader of the coalition that implemented the restrictions on Iraqi military activity.
The US immediately increased air sorties over Iraq, and on 1 September 1996 President Clinton announced that the US would aggressively respond to Iraq's breach of the agreements. From 3-4 September, the US conducted Operation Desert Strike, unilaterally bombing Iraqi military positions and air defense systems with apparent success. A reported 6 Iraqi's died in the attacks, with dozens of injuries. The US also extended the ""air exclusion zone"" in southern Iraq...

A crisis in the DRC (Zaire)-Rwanda protracted conflict
Background:
A rebellion in eastern Zaire led to another international crisis for Zaire and Rwanda, which escalated into an eight-month civil war in Zaire, from 8 October 1996 to 16 May 1997.
Background and Pre-Crisis
The Tutsi victory in the Rwandan civil war in 1994 ended in a predominantly Tutsi Patriotic Front government (FPR) in Rwanda, and bases of Rwandan Hutu refugees camps in the Kivu region in eastern Zaire. During 1996, the extremist Hutu Interahamwe militia, backed by the Zairean Armed Forces (FAZ), ousted thousands of Banyamulenge - ethnic Tutsis - from the Masisi region in North Kivu, in order to use the area for cross-border raids into Rwanda.
In the weeks prior to the crisis between Zaire and Rwanda, the Interahamwe militia tried to expel Banyamulenge forces from South Kivu, who were well armed and trained to fight back. In September 1996, fighting between the two ethnic groups flared up, and Zaire accused Rwanda of arming the Banyamulenge. Rwanda denied the charge.
In October, a major rebellion by the Banyamulenge in eastern Zaire, led by Laurent Kabila - the coordinator of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire-Congo (ADFL) - threatened the integrity of the state, whose president Mobutu Sese Seko had traveled to Switzerland for cancer treatment, and brought Rwanda and Zaire to the verge of war.
Summary:
On 8 October 1996, the deputy governor of South Kivu, Lwasi Ngabo, threatened to treat the Banyamulenge as rebels and to expel them unless they left Zaire in 6 days. As a result, about 1,000,000 Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi,...

Begin Crisis Narrative
A crisis in the DRC (Zaire)-Rwanda protracted conflict
Background:
A rebellion in eastern Zaire led to another international crisis for Zaire and Rwanda, which escalated into an eight-month civil war in Zaire, from 8 October 1996 to 16 May 1997.
Background and Pre-Crisis
The Tutsi victory in the Rwandan civil war in 1994 ended in a predominantly Tutsi Patriotic Front government (FPR) in Rwanda, and bases of Rwandan Hutu refugees camps in the Kivu region in eastern Zaire. During 1996, the extremist Hutu Interahamwe militia, backed by the Zairean Armed Forces (FAZ), ousted thousands of Banyamulenge - ethnic Tutsis - from the Masisi region in North Kivu, in order to use the area for cross-border raids into Rwanda.
In the weeks prior to the crisis between Zaire and Rwanda, the Interahamwe militia tried to expel Banyamulenge forces from South Kivu, who were well armed and trained to fight back. In September 1996, fighting between the two ethnic groups flared up, and Zaire accused Rwanda of arming the Banyamulenge. Rwanda denied the charge.
In October, a major rebellion by the Banyamulenge in eastern Zaire, led by Laurent Kabila - the coordinator of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire-Congo (ADFL) - threatened the integrity of the state, whose president Mobutu Sese Seko had traveled to Switzerland for cancer treatment, and brought Rwanda and Zaire to the verge of war.
Summary:
On 8 October 1996, the deputy governor of South Kivu, Lwasi Ngabo, threatened to treat the Banyamulenge as rebels and to expel them unless they left Zaire in 6 days. As a result, about 1,000,000 Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi,...

A crisis in the Greece/Turkey protracted conflict
Background:
A crisis between Cyprus and Turkey began on 24 January 1998 and was terminated on 29 December 1998.
Background and Pre-Crisis
In January 1997, the Cypriot government placed an order for the purchase of Russian made S-300 surface to air missiles. The S-300 has a range of about 140 kms, and would reportedly overturn the air superiority of the Turkish forces in the island. Several European governments, the US and the UN urged the Cypriot government to cancel the purchase to avoid further tensions with Turkey. While refusing to cancel the order, the Greek Cypriot government stated that there was no fixed date for the missile deployment. It added that the purchase was partly intended to focus international attention on the need for a solution to the wider Cyprus problem.
Summary:
The trigger to the crisis was the completion of a military airfield base alongside the civil airport in Paphos on 24 January 1998. The site was to be protected by the S-300 missiles. The completion of the airbase triggered a crisis for Turkey, which perceived it as a potential military threat to its airspace. The Turkish government warned that it may use force to prevent the deployment of the missiles. The threat of military action by Turkey triggered a crisis for Cyprus in late January 1998. Greece, although not an actor in this crisis, said that it would regard such an attack as cause for war with Turkey.
Concerned with the volatile situation, the EU threatened to suspend its accession talks with Cyprus if the weapons deployment were to occur. Following intense pressure from the EU, the US and the UN, and detailed discussions with Greece, Cyprus announced on 29 December 1998 that it was canceling its plans. The missiles would now be deployed on the Greek island of Crete, which meant that the Turkish airspace would no longer be threatened by the weapons. This was the end of the crisis. However, the Turkish government claimed that the deployment of the missiles in Crete would aggravate relations between NATO...

Begin Crisis Narrative
Background:
A crisis occurred between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 6 May 1998 to 12 December 2000, with both countries accusing the other of having invaded their sovereign territory. According to US estimates, the war led to the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers and the displacement of 650,000 people.
Background and Pre-Crisis
Eritrea became an independent nation in 1993, following a referendum on its secession from Ethiopia. Eritrean rebels had played an important role in establishing the Ethiopian government in 1991, and relations between the two countries had been cordial since the secession. The two countries were also linked by important economic agreements and had only recently ceased to use the same currency. The confrontation in May 1998 was a shock to the international community.
Summary:
On 6 May, border fighting between Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers triggered a crisis for both countries. It is unclear which side triggered the hostilities. On 13 May 1998, the Ethiopian Council of Ministers issued a formal statement, in which it accused Eritrea of having used military force on 6 May, to occupy an unspecified area of northwestern Ethiopia. On 14 May, the Eritrean government countered that the 6 May incident involved Ethiopian forces attacking Eritrean soldiers on Eritrean territory. Ethiopia subsequently diverted its imports and exports from Eritrean ports to Djibouti, allegedly because Eritrea was preventing Ethiopian access to its ports. Despite attempts by regional and international leaders to mediate, by late May, both countries had mobilized further troops and dug trenches inside the disputed areas. The situation rapidly escalated to a full-scale war.
With the onset of the rainy season, there was a scaling down of ground fighting at the end of May 1998. On 16 June 1998, Ethiopia and Eritrea ended air attacks, but the conflict remained far from settled. A peace plan, originally drafted by the US and Rwanda, and endors...
